## Notes

The Floating Cupcake represents the theme that you can't judge a book by its cover. Despite looking like a children's toy, it's a serious pirate vessel commanded by a capable captain. The ship's whimsical appearance actually helps Patricia in negotiations - people are less defensive when approached by a cupcake ship, making it easier to have honest conversations about environmental issues.

The ship's design also reflects Patricia's hidden softer side - she may be ruthless and honest, but she has a sense of humor and isn't afraid to be different. This makes her more approachable to Lily and her friends, ultimately leading to the successful negotiation about fishing practices.
