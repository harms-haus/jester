The [[Amazing Rainforest]] breathed a quiet, misty sigh as the sun slipped behind the towering kapok trees. [[Fireflies]] blinked like shy lanterns, and the air smelled of damp earth and sweet orchids. [[Lily]], a brave five‑year‑old with a braid that swayed like a meadow breeze, padded softly along a fern‑covered trail, her trusty companion [[Rascal]] trotting beside her, his masked face flashing mischievous grins.

They had just finished a game of “Hide‑and‑Seek” when a low, rumbling growl stopped them in their tracks. From a thicket emerged [[Bella Bear]], her massive brown fur dusted with pine needles, and two tiny cubs clinging to her legs. Bella’s eyes were wide with worry.

“Please,” Bella whispered, “the winter winds are coming early. My cubs need a safe den, but last year's den is flooded. Can you help us?”

Lily’s heart leapt. She loved puzzles and adventures, and she knew a brave heart could move mountains—or at least a few mossy stones. “We’ll find you a home,” she promised, squeezing Rascal’s paw. Rascal, ever the optimist, added with a wink, “And we’ll make sure it’s a den worth bragging about!”

The trio set off, deeper into the emerald labyrinth. The canopy above stitched together a roof of jade leaves, letting only thin ribbons of gold pierce the gloom. Birds sang hidden lullabies, and every rustle seemed to whisper a secret.

After a short walk, Lily’s keen eyes caught a hollow beneath a tangled tangle of vines—a natural cave that looked perfect for a bear family. The entrance was wide enough for Bella and her cubs, and it had a [[stone door]] pushed just out of the way.

“Here!” Lily exclaimed, pointing. “This could be the new den.”

Bella nudged the cubs forward and they waddled in, sniffing the dry floor approvingly, then headed back outside .  While Lily and Rascal inspected the entrance, the cubs scampered into a sunny clearing just a few steps away, tumbling over each other in a game of chase. Their giggles rose like wind chimes, bright and carefree.

Rascal crouched low, watching the playful cubs, when a sudden, sharp snarl ripped through the clearing.

[[Tigress Tess]], sleek and hungry, burst from the shadows, her orange‑striped coat flashing as she leapt onto a fallen log. Her eyes were as big as the moon, and her stomach growled louder than a drumbeat.

“Ah, a feast!” she snarled, teeth glinting like polished amber.

The sound froze the cubs mid‑tumble. They stared at the tiger, their tiny paws frozen in the soft grass. Bella’s ears twitched, and she turned her massive head toward the sound.

“Run!” Bella roared, scooping her cubs onto her back. Before Lily could protest, Bella rolled her massive shoulders into a moving hill, and Lily clambered onto the bear’s broad back, hugging the warm fur for balance. Rascal scrambled onto Bella’s flank, his tail twitching with nervous excitement.

“Why aren’t we fighting, Bella? You’re bigger than her!” Rascal shouted, his voice squeaky but determined.

The chase began.

Tigress Tess lunged, her paws thudding against the leaf‑laden floor. Bella roared, dodging to the left, while Lily held on tight. The [[Amazing Rainforest]] seemed to close in, branches reaching like giant fingers, yet the trio slipped through with surprising ease. Rascal’s sharp eyes scanned for any clue, any foothold, any chance to turn the tide.

Just when the chase reached its fevered peak, Lily’s gaze landed on a glint half‑buried beneath a fallen log near the den’s entrance. It was a [[stone wedge]]—broad, flat, and smooth as river‑polished glass. She remembered a story her mother once told: “A stone can hold a door shut, but only if you know how to place it.”

“Rascal!” Lily called, pointing. “Look! A [[stone wedge]]! It could close the den’s door!”

As Bella ran past the den's entrance again, Rascal hops off her back and onto the nearby tree, his tiny claws digging into the bark. He scrambled down and grabbed the wedge. Bella looped around the den. The tiger’s claws snapped inches from Bella’s paws, the air crackling with tension.

"Ready when you are Bella!" came the call from Rascal. Bella turned towards the den picking up speed as she runs. Tess just behind her ready to eat.

"NOW!" shouted Lily and Bella together as they dove into the den's front door. Rascal was already rolling the stone across the entrance and just in time. Lily leaped off Bella's back and slid to a stop right in front of the door. She grabbed the wedge and slammed it under the door and THUD! Tess slammed into the rockface. Her paw snapping wildly on thin air through the last gap in the doorway.

Tess snarled, “You think a tiny pebble can stop me? I'm strong Strong STRONG, little girl.” She jabbed her massive head, but the stone wedge held fast. The tiger’s frustration grew, and with a final, exhausted huff she slunk back into the shadows, defeated by a clever child and a sturdy rock rather than brute force.

Bella let out a deep, grateful sigh, her massive chest heaving in relief. “You did it, Lily,” she whispered, “you saved us all.” The cubs tumbled from her back, chittering with joy, their fur slick with rain but their eyes bright as sunrise.

"I still don't understand Bella, why didn't we fight? You could have totally beaten her," said Rascal now that they were safe. “You're right, I’d probably win, but my cubs and you and Lily could be hurt, and so could I. Fighting isn’t always the answer, Rascal,” Bella said, her voice gentle, not scolding.

The [[Amazing Rainforest]] seemed to exhale, the wind rustling through leaves like applause. [[Fireflies]] gathered outside, forming a glittering halo around the newly secured den. Lily and Rascal laughed, their voices mingling with the night’s chorus of crickets and distant owl hoots.

“Tonight,” Rascal said, his eyes twinkling, “we’ll tell the stars how a stone wedge beat a tiger.”

Lily giggled, “And we’ll remind everyone that ingenuity and smarts will always win over brute force, even when you have strength on your side.” The words felt like a promise, a glowing ember to carry them home.

As the moon rose, silvering the canopy, Bella led Lily and Rascal to the edge of the whispering woods where they quickly crafted a soft, warm fire.  The bear’s cubs curled up beside her, safe and snug, while Bella offered Lily a [[honey‑sweet berry]] as a token of thanks. Rascal, ever the comedian, tried to balance a pinecone on his nose, eliciting a chorus of giggles from the cubs.

When the night grew deep and the stars twinkled like scattered diamonds, Lily felt a gentle drowsiness settle over her. She waved goodbye to Bella and her cubs, promising to visit in the spring when the rainforest would be alive with blossoms.

Back on the familiar path to home, Lily’s steps were light, her mind brimming with the day’s adventure. The rain‑kissed leaves whispered lullabies, and Rascal curled up beside her, his tail forming a soft, furry blanket.

“Goodnight, woods,” Lily murmured, eyes closing as the world turned a shade softer. 

*Goodnight bright moon,
goodnight clever raccoon,
goodnight brave bear,
goodnight friends everywhere...*
