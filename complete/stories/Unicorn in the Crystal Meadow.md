_Evening settled over the little cottage village, sky a soft blue. [[Lily]] sat on the windowsill, her curls tangled like sunrise threads. Her trusty companion, [[Rascal]], whiskers twitching at every whisper of wind._

“Do you hear that, Rascal?” Lily asked.

A gentle rustle rose from the garden, followed by a voice as old as the hills. The [[Village Elder]], leaning on her wooden staff, shuffled forward. “You little brave one,” she said, “the great rainbow that once stretched over our village has lost its colors. The storm last night stole them, and now the sky is as grey as a stone‑washed river. Without its colors, the forest feels a bit less hopeful. I sense you have the heart to bring them back.”

[[Lily]]’s heart thumped like a drum. She remembered stories of rainbows—bridges of light that linked earth to sky, promises of wonder after rain. She squeezed Rascal’s paw. “We’ll find them, Elder. We’ll bring the rainbow home.”

The Elder smiled, her eyes twinkling like dewdrops. “Follow the whisper of the wind to the edge of the Whispering Woods. There you’ll find a friend who knows where the colors hide.”

The next morning, Lily slipped on her crimson scarf, tucked a tiny [[wooden spoon]]—her lucky explorer’s tool—into her basket, and stepped outside. Rascal scampered beside her, tail flicking with excitement.

Sunbeams pierced the canopy, painting the path with golden specks. As they walked, a soft silver glow shimmered between trunks.

“Look!” Lily whispered. Emerging from a thicket of ferns was a unicorn whose mane sparkled with tiny stars—[[Starlight Unicorn]], keeper of the sky’s glitter. Her horn curled like a delicate spiral of moonlight.

“Hello, little travelers,” Starlight said in a voice that sounded like wind chimes. “I am Starlight. I felt the rainbow’s sigh and have been waiting for brave hearts to help.”

Rascal tilted his head, eyes wide. “A unicorn! Does that mean we get extra sparkle points?”

Starlight chuckled, leaves swaying. “Indeed, Rascal. But first, we must find [[Ember Fox]], the clever fox who unintentionally gathered the [[Rainbow's Hues]]. He thought they were bright berries and hid them in his den.”

Lily nodded. “Then we must find Ember and ask for the colors back.”

Starlight lowered her head, and a trail of silver light spilled onto the mossy floor, forming a faint path that led deeper into the woods.

The trio followed the glowing trail until they reached [[Crystal Meadow]], a clearing where grass glittered like tiny diamonds and a crystal‑clear pond mirrored clouds. The air smelled of lavender and fresh rain; sunlight danced on water’s surface.

But before they could rest, a rustle sounded from a nearby thicket. Out hopped a fox with russet coat flickering orange—[[Ember Fox]], the fox, eyes alight with curiosity.

“Who—who are you?” Ember asked. “And why do you have a unicorn with you?”

Starlight bowed gracefully. “I am Starlight, guardian of the sky’s colors. We have come because the rainbow’s hues have been misplaced, and we believe you may have taken them by mistake.”

Ember’s ears twitched. “I… I found shining things near the [[Giggly Stream]] last night. They looked like juicy berries, so I gathered them to keep them safe. I stored them in my den, but they kept humming and glowing. I didn’t know they were the rainbow’s hues!”

Lily stepped forward, voice gentle but firm. “Ember, the colors belong to the sky. They help the world feel hopeful. May we go get them together?”

Ember’s eyes softened. “I didn’t mean harm. If you help me get rid of the humming thing, I’ll give them back. And maybe… I can learn why sharing is better than keeping them all to myself.”

To free the colors, Ember led Lily, Rascal, and Starlight to his burrow—a cozy network beneath a twisted oak. Inside, the hidden stash glowed like a miniature sunrise. Ember brought the rainbow's hues out of the den back to the crystal meadow.

The colors were bound by a tangled knot of magic, shimmering like a spider’s web of light. The knot could only be undone by solving a riddle:

Starlight read the text on the knot: “What walks on four legs in the morning, two at noon, and three when night falls?”

Rascal squeaked, “A sleepy kitten! It crawls, then hops, then curls up!”

Lily giggled, but the correct answer was clearer: "a child". She answered gently, “Because a child grows and changes—four legs as a baby, two legs as an adult, and three legs when we use a cane or a crutch.”

The knot loosened, a soft chime rang through the burrow. The knot brightened. Ember’s tail flickered like a lantern in excitement. Starlight reared her head, horn glowing fiercely, weaving the colors into a sturdy bridge of light. The burst of giggles from the fox, Rascal, and Lily made the colors swirl upward, forming a radiant arc that stretched across the meadow and toward the sky.

Just as the rainbow began to rise, dark clouds gathered, trying to swallow the light. The wind howled, but Starlight’s magic anchored the colors; Ember’s quick paws held them steady; Rascal tightened each colored knot of light; Lily sang a soft lullaby—“The sky will mend, the colors blend. The wind will try to bite us. Our voices one, the repair is done. Love above us to bind us.” The song resonated through the meadow, calming the storm clouds, which dissolved into gentle mist.

The rainbow completed its arc, stretching from Crystal Meadow to the village rooftops—a vivid bridge of hope that glittered like a promise.

The four adventurers return home. “You have returned the sky’s smile,” said the elder, handing Lily a tiny [[crystal vial]] filled with a single [[glowing droplet]] of rainbow light. “Keep this as a reminder that bravery, kindness, and laughter can bring color back to the world.”

Lily tucked the vial safely into her pocket. “Thank you for your help, Starlight, Ember, and Rascal. I’ll share this story with Mom, too.”

Starlight bowed her head, her mane shedding a few twinkling strands that fell like silver snowflakes. “Remember, Lily, every storm ends with a rainbow if you keep looking up.”

Ember nudged Lily’s hand with his nose. “And if you ever need bright berries, ask first—sharing makes the flavor sweeter!”

Rascal giggled, “I guess I’ll add ‘rainbow‑catcher’ to my résumé!”

The friends laughed together, their voices weaving into the evening air like music.

_And as the moon rose, casting a silver ribbon across the sleeping village, Lily drifted into dreams of sparkling meadows, friendly foxes, and unicorns who painted the world with wonder._
