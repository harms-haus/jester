# Workflow Title

## Purpose

Describe the purpose of this workflow and what it does

## Definitions

- a `Concept` is a thing we'll be using
- a `Concept` could be this or that example
- it's a good idea to include plural `Concepts` too

- define other `things` in a separate list
- use many ways to describe `things`

## Sequential Tasks

***CRITICAL: Do not proceed to the next task until the current task is complete***

### 1. Step One

- **Do a thing:** Do this thing
- **Do a different thing:** Do that thing
  - That thing has multiple parts
  - That might be useful
  - Or maybe it's helpful examples

### 2. Another Step

- Use directory lists for scripts to run from `./.jester/validation/`:
  - [Some validation](some-validation.md): Load a validation to run before this section
- **Mixing lists:**
  1. **It's fine:** It's perfectly fine
  2. **Don't worry:** Don't worry about it

### N. Generate Report

Provide a structured workflow completion report including:

#### Summary of things done

- Number of things done
- Number of things done successfully
- Number of thing failed
- Doing completion status

#### Workflow Results

- [x] List of successfully done things
- [ ] List of failed things
  *with reasons or debugging details*
- [x] Additional things done

#### Final Assessment

- **SUCCESS**: All things done successfully
- **PARTIAL**: Some things failed, manual review required
- **FAILED**: A lot of things failed, rollback required
