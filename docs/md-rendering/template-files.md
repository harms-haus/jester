# Template Files

Template files are example files with spaces marked for {{SPECIFIC_DATA}} which will be filled in at {{USAGE_TIME}} which may be as a prompt for the agent or as {{OUTPUT_FILE}} for the user. The {{TEMPLATE_VARIABLES}} will be as descriptive as possible to support you in collecting the data you need to present to the user. But where the variable name is unable to {{COMPLETELY_CAPTURE:the nuances of the situation, a template comment is what you need to use, but don't overuse them like this, because *this is too long*}}

## File Formats

- Template files may be in markdown
- Template files may be in yaml
- Template files may have ANY EXTENSION, but `*.md` for markdown and `*.yaml` for yaml files is preferred
