# Architectural Patterns

## Agent-Based Architecture

**Pattern**: Specialized agents with specific responsibilities  
**Benefits**: Clear separation of concerns, easy to extend and modify  
**Implementation**: Prompt-based agents with file-based communication  
**Trade-offs**: Requires careful prompt engineering, limited programmatic control  

## File-Based Pipeline

**Pattern**: Agents communicate through structured files  
**Benefits**: Human-readable intermediate results, easy debugging  
**Implementation**: YAML for context, Markdown for outlines and stories  
**Trade-offs**: File I/O overhead, potential race conditions  

## Local-First Storage

**Pattern**: All user data stored locally with optional cloud sync  
**Benefits**: Privacy, offline operation, complete control  
**Implementation**: Git for versioning, local file system for storage  
**Trade-offs**: No automatic backup, requires manual sync management  

## Knowledge Graph Integration

**Pattern**: External knowledge graph for entity relationships  
**Benefits**: Rich entity discovery, relationship mapping  
**Implementation**: LightRAG OpenAPI integration with local caching  
**Trade-offs**: External dependency, potential latency
