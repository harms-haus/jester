2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
3. **Least Privilege**: Minimal access rights and permissions
4. **Data Minimization**: Collect and store only necessary data
5. **Transparency**: Clear security practices and user control

## Authentication and Authorization

### Authentication Mechanisms

**Local File System Authentication**:
```markdown
## File System Access Control
- **User Permissions**: Standard file system permissions
- **Directory Access**: Restricted to user's home directory
- **File Operations**: User-level file operations only
- **Process Isolation**: Single-user system, no multi-user concerns
```

### Authorization Model

**Single-User Authorization**:
```markdown
## Authorization Model
- **User Type**: Single user (parent/guardian)
- **Access Level**: Full access to own data
- **Data Isolation**: Complete data isolation
- **Permission Model**: User owns all data and controls access
```

**File System Authorization**:
```typescript
interface FileSystemAuthorization {
  local: {
    read: boolean;    // Read local files
    write: boolean;   // Write local files
    execute: boolean; // Execute scripts
  };
  universe: {
    read: boolean;    // Read universe entities
    write: boolean;   // Write universe entities
    delete: boolean;  // Delete universe entities
  };
  reading: {
    read: boolean;    // Read story content
    write: boolean;   // Write story content
    delete: boolean;  // Delete story content
  };
}
```

## Data Protection

### Data Classification

**Data Types**:
```markdown
## Data Classification
1. **Public Data**: Templates, examples, documentation
2. **User Data**: Stories, characters, personal content
3. **System Data**: Configuration, logs, temporary files
4. **Sensitive Data**: User preferences, personal information
```

**Data Handling Requirements**:
```yaml
data_protection:
  user_data:
    storage: "local_only"
    encryption: "file_system"
    backup: "user_controlled"
    retention: "indefinite"
  system_data:
    storage: "local_only"
    encryption: "file_system"
    backup: "automatic"
    retention: "30_days"
  sensitive_data:
    storage: "local_only"
    encryption: "file_system"
    backup: "user_controlled"
    retention: "user_controlled"
```

### Data Encryption

**Encryption Strategy**:
```markdown
## Encryption Implementation
- **File System Encryption**: Rely on OS-level encryption
- **Data at Rest**: File system encryption
- **Data in Transit**: HTTPS/TLS for any network communication
- **Key Management**: OS-level key management
```

**Encryption Standards**:
```yaml
encryption:
  algorithm: "AES-256"
  key_management: "OS_managed"
  file_system: "OS_encryption"
  network: "TLS_1.3"
```

## File System Security

### Directory Structure Security

**Directory Permissions**:
```markdown
## Directory Security Model
- **Universe Directory**: Read/write for user only
- **Reading Directory**: Read/write for user only
- **Draft Directory**: Read/write for user only
- **Memory Directory**: Read/write for user only
- **Jester Directory**: Read-only for user, write for system
```

**File Permissions**:
```bash
# Example file permissions
universe/          755  # rwxr-xr-x
reading/           755  # rwxr-xr-x
draft/             755  # rwxr-xr-x
memory/            755  # rwxr-xr-x
.jester/           755  # rwxr-xr-x
.cursorrules       644  # rw-r--r--
```

### File Access Controls

**Access Control Model**:
```typescript
interface FileAccessControl {
  universe: {
    characters: "user_read_write";
    locations: "user_read_write";
    items: "user_read_write";
  };
  reading: {
    stories: "user_read_write";
    contexts: "user_read_write";
    outlines: "user_read_write";
  };
  draft: {
    temp_files: "user_read_write";
    work_in_progress: "user_read_write";
  };
  memory: {
    preferences: "user_read_write";
    settings: "user_read_write";
  };
}
```

## Compliance Requirements

### Data Privacy Compliance

**Privacy Principles**:
```markdown
## Privacy Compliance

6. **Transparency**: Clear privacy practices
7. **User Control**: User controls their own data
```

**Privacy Controls**:
```yaml

## Conclusion

This security controls document provides a comprehensive framework for ensuring the security and privacy of the Jester system. By following these guidelines and implementing the recommended controls, we can maintain a secure environment that protects user data while providing a reliable and trustworthy story creation platform.

The key to effective security is to integrate it into every aspect of the system, from development to operations, and to continuously monitor and improve security practices based on emerging threats and best practices.
