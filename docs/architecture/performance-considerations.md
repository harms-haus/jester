# Performance Considerations

## Response Time

- **Agent Operations**: Prompt-based, depends on LLM response time
- **File Operations**: Local file I/O, minimal latency
- **LightRAG Queries**: Cached responses, offline mode support
- **Git Operations**: Background operations, non-blocking

## Scalability

- **Story Volume**: Limited by local storage capacity
- **Entity Count**: Limited by LightRAG service capacity
- **Concurrent Operations**: Single-user system, no concurrency concerns
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal, file-based processing

## Optimization Strategies

- **Caching**: LightRAG responses cached locally
- **Lazy Loading**: Entities loaded on demand
- **Batch Operations**: Multiple file operations batched together
- **Background Processing**: Analytics and validation run in background
