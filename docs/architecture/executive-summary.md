This document outlines the technical architecture for **jester**, a prompt-based bedtime story generation system that adapts BMAD principles for interactive storytelling. The system uses a 3-stage workflow (context → outline → story) with specialized agents, LightRAG integration for entity management, and local file-based storage with wiki-style linking.
