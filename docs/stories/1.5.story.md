# Story 1.5: Basic Edit Functionality

## Story Information
- **Epic**: 1 - Foundation & Core Infrastructure
- **Story Number**: 1.5
- **Status**: Draft
- **Created**: 2024-12-19
- **Last Modified**: 2024-12-19

## Story Statement

As a **parent creating bedtime stories**,
I want **to use the `/edit` command to modify outlines and stories**,
so that **I can refine the content without regenerating from scratch**.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **`/edit` command accepts file path and edit instructions** for outlines and stories
2. **Edit operations are applied** to the specified file without regeneration
3. **File integrity is maintained** after edit operations
4. **User can edit character names, plot points, and story content** directly
5. **Edit changes are saved** to the original file
6. **User receives confirmation** of successful edit operations
7. **Backup files are created** before major edit operations

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.1 established the basic project structure and agent framework with the `.jester/` directory structure and command router system. Story 1.2 implemented the MuseAgent with comprehensive context generation, including three plot templates (Hero's Journey, Pixar Method, Golden Circle), target audience selection, and YAML file generation. Story 1.3 implemented the WriteAgent with outline generation functionality, including plot template integration, character assignment, and metadata propagation. Story 1.4 implemented the WriteAgent with story generation functionality, including outline file reading, story content generation, and file saving. The command router system is functional and can handle slash commands with proper validation and error handling.

### Data Models
Based on architecture documentation, the following data structures will be used for edit operations:

**StoryContext Interface** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#Core Data Structures]:
```typescript
interface StoryContext {
  title: string;
  target_audience: {
    age_range: string;
    reading_level: string;
  };
  target_length: {
    min_words: number;
    max_words: number;
    final_target: number; // After editing
  };
  entities: {
    characters: EntityReference[];
    locations: EntityReference[];
    items: EntityReference[];
  };
  plot_template: string; // 'heroes_journey', 'pixar', 'golden_circle'
  plot_points: PlotPoint[];
  location_progression: LocationTransition[];
  morals: string[];
  themes: string[];
  metadata: {
    created_at: string;
    last_modified: string;
    version: number;
  };
}
```

**StoryOutline Interface** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#Core Data Structures]:
```typescript
interface StoryOutline {
  title: string;
  target_audience: StoryContext['target_audience'];
  target_length: StoryContext['target_length'];
  plot_points: DetailedPlotPoint[];
  estimated_word_count: number;
  metadata: {
    context_file: string;
    created_at: string;
    last_modified: string;
  };
}
```

**Story Interface** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#Core Data Structures]:
```typescript
interface Story {
  title: string;
  content: string;
  word_count: number;
  metadata: {
    outline_file: string;
    context_file: string;
    created_at: string;
    last_modified: string;
    reading_time_minutes: number;
  };
}
```

### File Locations
Based on the source tree structure [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#Project Structure]:

**Required Files to Create/Modify:**
- `src/agents/editAgent.ts` - New EditAgent implementation for file editing functionality
- `outlines/` - Directory for reading and modifying outline files (already exists)
- `stories/` - Directory for reading and modifying story files (already exists)
- `contexts/` - Directory for reading and modifying context files (already exists)

**Existing Files to Integrate With:**
- `src/agents/commandRouter.ts` - Command router system (needs `/edit` command)
- `src/utils/fileUtils.ts` - File operations utilities for backup and validation
- `src/utils/errorHandler.ts` - Error handling system

### Technical Constraints
**Tech Stack Requirements** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Core Technologies]:
- **Runtime**: Node.js with TypeScript
- **Package Manager**: npm
- **File System**: Node.js fs module with fs-extra
- **Dependencies**: @types/node, yaml, fs-extra

**Coding Standards** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#TypeScript Standards]:
- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Prefer interfaces over types for object shapes
- Use explicit return types for public methods
- Follow camelCase for variables and functions
- Use PascalCase for classes and interfaces

**Error Handling** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Error Handling]:
- Use try-catch blocks for async operations
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Log errors with context information
- Graceful degradation for non-critical failures

### Agent Framework Requirements
**Architecture Pattern** [Source: architecture/architectural-patterns.md#Agent-Based Architecture]:
- **Agent-based file pipeline** with specialized agents for specific responsibilities
- **Command-line interface** with slash commands
- **File-Based Pipeline**: Agents communicate through structured files (YAML, Markdown)
- **Prompt-Based Agents**: All agent behavior defined through structured prompts, no custom code

**Required Agent Commands** [Source: epic-1-foundation-core-infrastructure.md#Story 1.5]:
- `/edit` - File editing command for outlines and stories

### Edit Functionality Workflow
Based on the component architecture [Source: architecture/architectural-patterns.md#File-Based Pipeline]:
1. User runs `/edit` command with file path and edit instructions
2. Edit Agent reads the specified file (outline, story, or context)
3. Agent parses the file content and validates structure
4. Agent applies edit operations based on user instructions
5. Agent creates backup file before making changes
6. Agent saves modified content to original file
7. User receives confirmation of successful edit operations

### File Type Support
The edit functionality will support:
- **Context files** (YAML format) - Character names, plot points, themes, metadata
- **Outline files** (Markdown format) - Plot structure, character integration, descriptions
- **Story files** (Markdown format) - Story content, title, summary, narrative

### Backup and Safety
- Create timestamped backup files before major edit operations
- Validate file integrity after edit operations
- Maintain original file structure and formatting
- Provide rollback capability through backup files

### Testing
**Test file location**: `src/__tests__/editAgent.test.ts` (new test file)
**Testing frameworks**: Jest [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Development Tools]
**Test standards**: Unit tests for all edit functionality, integration tests for command router, file operation tests
