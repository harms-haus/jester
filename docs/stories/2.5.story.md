### Data Models
Based on the established entity system [Source: architecture/data-models.md#Core Data Structures]:

**Entity Structure**:
```typescript
interface Entity {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  type: 'character' | 'location' | 'item';
  description: string;
  properties: Record<string, any>;
  relationships: string[];
  last_used: string;
  usage_count: number;
}
```

**Relationship Discovery Data**:
```typescript
interface RelationshipSuggestion {
  source_entity: string;
  target_entity: string;
  relationship_type: string;
  confidence_score: number;
  reasoning: string;
  suggested_properties: Record<string, any>;
}

interface EntityConnection {
  entity_id: string;
  connected_entities: Array<{
    entity_id: string;
    relationship_type: string;
