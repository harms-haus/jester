# Story 1.4: Basic Story Generation

## Story Information
- **Epic**: 1 - Foundation & Core Infrastructure
- **Story Number**: 1.4
- **Status**: Done
- **Created**: 2024-12-19
- **Last Modified**: 2025-09-21

## Story Statement

As a **parent creating bedtime stories**,
I want **to use the `/write story` command to generate a complete story**,
so that **I can create a bedtime story from the outline**.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **`/write story` command reads outline Markdown file** and generates story
2. **Story Markdown file is created** with complete narrative at target length
3. **Story includes title and summary** generated from outline content
4. **Character names and details are consistent** with outline specifications
5. **Story follows the plot structure** defined in the outline
6. **Story file is saved** to stories/ directory with timestamp
7. **User receives confirmation** of story creation with file path

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.1 established the basic project structure and agent framework with the `.jester/` directory structure and command router system. Story 1.2 implemented the MuseAgent with comprehensive context generation, including three plot templates (Hero's Journey, Pixar Method, Golden Circle), target audience selection, and YAML file generation. Story 1.3 implemented the WriteAgent with outline generation functionality, including plot template integration, character assignment, and metadata propagation. The command router system is functional and can handle slash commands with proper validation and error handling.

### Data Models
Based on architecture documentation, the following data structures will be implemented:

**Story Interface** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#Core Data Structures]:
```typescript
interface Story {
  title: string;
  content: string;
  word_count: number;
  metadata: {
    outline_file: string;
    context_file: string;
    created_at: string;
    last_modified: string;
    reading_time_minutes: number;
  };
}
```

**StoryOutline Interface** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#Core Data Structures]:
```typescript
interface StoryOutline {
  title: string;
  target_audience: StoryContext['target_audience'];
  target_length: StoryContext['target_length'];
  plot_points: DetailedPlotPoint[];
  estimated_word_count: number;
  metadata: {
    context_file: string;
    created_at: string;
    last_modified: string;
  };
}
```

**DetailedPlotPoint Interface** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#Core Data Structures]:
```typescript
interface DetailedPlotPoint {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string; // 2-3 sentence description
  characters: string[]; // Character names involved
  location: string; // Location name
  estimated_words: number;
  order: number;
}
```

### File Locations
Based on the source tree structure [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#Project Structure]:

**Required Files to Create/Modify:**
- `src/agents/writeAgent.ts` - Extend existing WriteAgent with story generation functionality
- `stories/` - Directory for generated story files (already exists)
- `.jester/templates/story.md` - Story template (already exists from Story 1.1)

**Existing Files to Integrate With:**
- `src/agents/commandRouter.ts` - Command router system (needs `/write story` command)
- `src/utils/fileUtils.ts` - File operations utilities
- `src/utils/errorHandler.ts` - Error handling system
- `outlines/` - Directory for reading outline files

### Technical Constraints
**Tech Stack Requirements** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Core Technologies]:
- **Runtime**: Node.js with TypeScript
- **Package Manager**: npm
- **File System**: Node.js fs module with fs-extra
- **Dependencies**: @types/node, yaml, fs-extra

**Coding Standards** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#TypeScript Standards]:
- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Prefer interfaces over types for object shapes
- Use explicit return types for public methods
- Follow camelCase for variables and functions
- Use PascalCase for classes and interfaces

**Error Handling** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Error Handling]:
- Use try-catch blocks for async operations
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Log errors with context information
- Graceful degradation for non-critical failures

### Agent Framework Requirements
**Architecture Pattern** [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#System Overview]:
- **Agent-based file pipeline** with external knowledge graph integration
- **Command-line interface** with slash commands
- **File-Based Pipeline**: Agents communicate through structured files (YAML, Markdown)
- **Prompt-Based Agents**: All agent behavior defined through structured prompts, no custom code

**Required Agent Commands** [Source: epic-1-foundation-core-infrastructure.md#Story 1.4]:
- `/write story` - Story generation command

### Story Generation Workflow
Based on the component architecture [Source: architecture/components.md#Core Components]:
1. User runs `/write story` command
2. Story Generation Agent reads outline file from `outlines/` directory
3. Agent processes plot points and character information
4. Agent generates complete narrative following plot structure
5. Story file saved to `stories/` directory with timestamp
6. User receives confirmation with file path

### Character and Plot Integration
- Extract character names and details from outline plot points
- Ensure character consistency throughout story generation
- Follow plot structure defined in outline
- Maintain target word count based on outline specifications
- Generate appropriate reading level content based on target audience

### Testing
**Test file location**: `src/__tests__/writeAgent.test.ts` (extend existing test file)
**Testing frameworks**: Jest [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Development Tools]
**Test standards**: Unit tests for all story generation functionality, integration tests for command router
