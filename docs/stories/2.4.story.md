# Story 2.4: Implement Draft/Ready/Complete Workflow System

## Story Information
- **Epic**: 2 - Entity Management System
- **Story Number**: 2.4
- **Status**: Complete
- **Created**: 2025-01-27
- **Last Modified**: 2025-01-27

## Story Statement

As a **parent building a story universe**,
I want **to use a clear draft/reading/universe workflow for organizing my work**,
so that **I can easily manage work in progress, approved content, and published stories**.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Draft directory structure** is created with draft/, reading/, and universe/ folders with proper subdirectories
2. **Draft numbering system** uses 3-digit incrementing numbers (001, 002, 013, etc.) for all draft files
3. **Draft file naming** follows patterns: context-{number}.md, outline-{number}.md, story-{number}.md
4. **Entity creation** happens directly in reading/ directory when approved, using standard naming conventions
5. **Draft number consistency** is maintained across all files in a draft (context-013.md → outline-013.md → story-013.md)
6. **Workflow commands** provide /edit approve-draft {number} and /edit publish "{title}" functionality
7. **File history tracking** maintains creation and modification timestamps with change summaries
8. **Agent prompt updates** reflect new workflow system across all agents
9. **Documentation updates** reflect new workflow in PRD and architecture documents
10. **Entity file naming** follows consistent patterns: `{Entity Name with Proper Casing, Punctuation and Spacing}.md` for new entities, `{Entity Name with Proper Casing, Punctuation and Spacing}.patch.md` for patches
11. **Patch file format** uses proper git-patch format with BEFORE/AFTER sections
12. **Conflict detection** scans target directories and warns users about potential overwrites
13. **User approval workflow** requires explicit confirmation for any conflicts before proceeding
14. **Patch application** processes entity patches before copying files during publish
15. **Complete cleanup** removes all published files from reading/{NNN} - Story Title/ directory after successful publish
16. **Change history** updates universe/ entity files with patch information and deletes patch files after application

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 2.3 established entity management with draft workflow support. The foundation includes:
- Entity management agent with CRUD operations
- Draft entity management with new-{type}-{name} naming
- Draft workflow support for maintaining consistency
- Import functionality for entities and stories

### Workflow System Overview
This story implements a three-stage development workflow:

**Draft Stage** (`draft/{NNN}/` directory):
- Work in progress organized by story project number
- Structure: characters/, contexts/, items/, locations/, outlines/, stories/
- Each project has unique 3-digit number (001, 002, 013, etc.)
- Files maintain project number consistency

**Reading Stage** (`reading/{NNN} - Story Title/` directory):
- Approved work ready for review and reading
- Structure: characters/, contexts/, items/, locations/, outlines/, stories/
- Includes descriptive story title for easy identification
- Clean naming without draft numbers

**Universe Stage** (`universe/` directory):
- Published work in final form
- Final story and entity files
- Clean, referenceable file names

### Agent Behavior Rules
**Workflow Management** [Source: architecture/agent-patterns.md#Prompt-Based Agents]:
- Edit agent handles workflow progression through prompt-based rules
- File operations managed through agent prompts, not TypeScript classes
- Workflow validation managed by agent persona and behavior rules
- Error handling through prompt-based responses and suggestions

### Data Models
Based on the new workflow system:

**Draft File Structure**:
```yaml
draft_number: string  # 3-digit number (001, 002, 013, etc.)
file_type: 'context' | 'outline' | 'story'
content: string
metadata:
  created_at: string
  last_modified: string
  change_summary: string
  version: number
```

**Entity File Structure in Drafts**:
```yaml
draft_number: string
entity_type: 'character' | 'location' | 'item'
descriptive_name: string  # Used in filename
content: string
metadata:
  created_at: string
  last_modified: string
  change_summary: string
  version: number
```

### Agent Command Specifications
**Workflow Commands** [Source: architecture/agent-patterns.md#Agent Commands]:
- `/edit approve-draft {draft-number}` - Move draft to reading/ directory
- `/edit publish "{story-title}"` - Move reading story to universe/ directory
- `/edit create-draft {draft-number}` - Create new draft with specified number
- `/edit list-drafts` - List all current drafts
- `/edit list-reading` - List all reading content
- `/edit list-universe` - List all universe content

### File Locations
Based on the new workflow structure:

**Required Files to Create/Modify:**
- `draft/` - New directory for work in progress
- `reading/` - New directory for approved content organized by story project
- `universe/` - New directory for published content
- `.jester/agents/edit.md` - Update with workflow commands
- `.jester/prompts/workflow-management.md` - New workflow management prompts
- `docs/prd.md` - Update with new workflow requirements
- `docs/architecture/source-tree.md` - Update directory structure

**Existing Files to Update:**
- `.jester/agents/write.md` - Update file saving to use draft workflow
- `.jester/agents/muse.md` - Update context saving to use draft workflow
- `.jester/agents/entity.md` - Update entity creation to use draft workflow
- All prompt files - Update to reflect new workflow

### Testing Requirements
**Test file locations**: 
- `src/__tests__/workflow.test.ts` (new test file)

**Testing frameworks**: Jest [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Development Tools]

**Test standards**: 
- Unit tests for workflow command processing
- Integration tests for draft → reading → universe progression
- Validation tests for draft number consistency
- Error handling tests for workflow operations

### Technical Constraints
**Tech Stack Requirements** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Core Technologies]:
- **Runtime**: Node.js with TypeScript
- **Package Manager**: npm
- **File System**: Node.js fs module with fs-extra
- **Dependencies**: @types/node, yaml, fs-extra

**Coding Standards** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#TypeScript Standards]:
- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Prefer interfaces over types for object shapes
- Use explicit return types for public methods
- Follow camelCase for variables and functions
- Use PascalCase for classes and interfaces

**Error Handling** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Error Handling]:
- Use try-catch blocks for async operations
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Log errors with context information
- Graceful degradation for non-critical failures

### Workflow Features to Implement
**Directory Structure Creation**:
- Create draft/, reading/, universe/ directories
- Set up proper subdirectory structure
- Ensure directory permissions and access

**Draft Numbering System**:
- 3-digit incrementing numbers (001, 002, 013, etc.)
- No renumbering - numbers are permanent
- Consistent across all files in a draft

**File Naming Conventions**:
- Draft files: context-{number}.md, outline-{number}.md, story-{number}.md
- Entities: Created directly in reading/{NNN} - Story Title/ directory when approved
- Reading/Universe: Clean names without numbers

**Workflow Commands**:
- Draft creation and management
- Approval process (draft → reading)
- Publication process (reading → universe)
- Listing and status commands

**File History Tracking**:
- Creation timestamps and summaries
- Modification history with change summaries
- Version tracking through workflow progression
- Git integration for detailed version control
