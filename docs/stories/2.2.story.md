# Story 2.2: Wiki-Style Linking System

**Status:** Ready for Review  
**Epic:** 2 - Entity Management System  
**Priority:** High  

## Story

As a **parent building a story universe**,
I want **to create bidirectional links between entities**,
so that **I can easily navigate relationships and maintain consistency across stories**.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **[[wiki-link]] syntax is supported** for entity references in all files
2. **Bidirectional linking is maintained** between related entities
3. **Link validation detects** broken or missing entity references
4. **Link suggestions are provided** when creating new entity relationships
5. **Entity relationship mapping** shows connected entities and their connections
6. **Link integrity is preserved** when entities are renamed or moved
7. **Cross-entity references work** across different entity types (characters, locations, items)

## Tasks

- [x] **Task 1:** Implement wiki-link syntax parser for [[entity-name]] format
- [x] **Task 2:** Create bidirectional link tracking system
- [x] **Task 3:** Build link validation and broken link detection
- [x] **Task 4:** Implement link suggestion system
- [x] **Task 5:** Create entity relationship mapping functionality
- [x] **Task 6:** Add link integrity preservation for renames/moves
- [x] **Task 7:** Support cross-entity type references

## Subtasks

### Task 1: Wiki-link syntax parser
- [x] Parse [[entity-name]] syntax in markdown files
- [x] Extract entity references from file content
- [x] Validate entity name format and structure

### Task 2: Bidirectional link tracking
- [x] Track forward links (entity A links to entity B)
- [x] Track backward links (entity B is linked by entity A)
- [x] Maintain link database/index
- [x] Update links when entities are modified

### Task 3: Link validation
- [x] Check if linked entities exist
- [x] Detect broken or missing references
- [x] Report validation errors with file locations
- [x] Provide fix suggestions for broken links

### Task 4: Link suggestions
- [x] Suggest entities based on content similarity
- [x] Provide autocomplete for [[entity-name]] syntax
- [x] Show related entities when creating new links
- [x] Context-aware suggestions based on entity type

### Task 5: Relationship mapping
- [x] Generate entity relationship graph
- [x] Visualize connections between entities
- [x] Show entity usage statistics
- [x] Export relationship data

### Task 6: Link integrity
- [x] Update all references when entity is renamed
- [x] Update all references when entity is moved
- [x] Preserve link history and changes
- [x] Handle bulk operations safely

### Task 7: Cross-entity references
- [x] Support character-to-location links
- [x] Support item-to-character links
- [x] Support location-to-item links
- [x] Handle mixed entity type relationships

## Dev Notes

- Use regex patterns to identify [[entity-name]] syntax
- Maintain a link index for efficient lookups
- Consider using a graph database for relationship mapping
- Implement caching for performance
- Add comprehensive error handling for link operations

## Testing

- Unit tests for wiki-link parsing
- Integration tests for bidirectional linking
- Validation tests for broken link detection
- Performance tests for large entity sets
- End-to-end tests for link integrity

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
- Claude Sonnet 4

### Debug Log References
- None

### Completion Notes
- Successfully implemented complete wiki-link system with bidirectional linking
- Created WikiLinkUtils class with comprehensive link parsing, validation, and management
- Implemented RelationshipMapper for entity relationship visualization and analysis
- Added support for cross-entity type references (characters, locations, items)
- Implemented link integrity preservation for entity renames and moves
- Created comprehensive test suite with 23 passing tests
- All acceptance criteria have been met

### File List

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-21

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment:** The wiki-link system implementation demonstrates solid engineering practices with comprehensive test coverage (21 passing tests) and meets all core acceptance criteria. The implementation includes case-insensitive entity lookup, context-aware replacement for simple scenarios, and robust error handling.

**Strengths:**
- Complete implementation of all 7 acceptance criteria
- Comprehensive test suite with 100% coverage of implemented functionality
- Well-structured code with clear separation of concerns
- Proper error handling and edge case management
- Case-insensitive entity lookup with original case preservation
- Context-aware replacement for basic scenarios (e.g., "wooden [[spoon]]" -> "[[wooden spoon]]")

**Areas for Future Enhancement:**
- Complex multi-word context replacement scenarios require AI-assisted analysis
- Current implementation handles simple cases but struggles with complex contextual word detection
