# Story 1.7: Agent Procedure Recognition & File Loading Reliability

## Story Details

**Epic:** 1 - Foundation & Core Infrastructure  
**Story ID:** 1.7  
**Priority:** High  
**Effort:** Medium  
**Status:** Ready for Development  

## User Story

**As a** user of the jester system  
**I want** agents to properly recognize and load relevant procedure files when I make plain language requests  
**So that** I can get reliable procedure execution without having to use explicit commands

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **AC1:** Agents can identify relevant procedure files from plain language requests
  - Given a user makes a plain language request for a procedure
  - When the agent processes the request
  - Then the agent identifies the correct procedure file(s) to load
  - And the agent loads those files into context before execution

- [ ] **AC2:** Agents load the correct files into context before executing procedures
  - Given a user requests a procedure in plain language
  - When the agent executes the procedure
  - Then all relevant procedure files are loaded into context
  - And the procedure executes with full context available

- [ ] **AC3:** Debug mode properly tracks and displays loaded context files
  - Given debug mode is activated
  - When an agent loads procedure files
  - Then debug mode displays all loaded context files
  - And the user can see what files were loaded and why

- [ ] **AC4:** Plain language requests result in the same reliable execution as explicit commands
  - Given a user makes both plain language and explicit command requests for the same procedure
  - When both requests are processed
  - Then both result in identical, reliable execution
  - And both load the same context files

- [ ] **AC5:** System maintains context retention across procedure execution
  - Given an agent loads procedure files into context
  - When the procedure executes
  - Then context is maintained throughout execution
  - And context is available for all procedure steps

- [ ] **AC6:** User receives clear feedback about what files were loaded and why
  - Given an agent loads procedure files
  - When the user requests information about loaded context
  - Then the agent provides clear feedback about loaded files
  - And the agent explains why those files were selected

## Technical Requirements

### Procedure Recognition Logic
- Implement intelligent procedure file identification from plain language requests
- Support fuzzy matching for procedure names and descriptions
- Maintain fallback mechanisms for ambiguous requests
- Provide user feedback when procedure identification is uncertain

### File Loading Mechanism
- Ensure reliable loading of identified procedure files into context
- Maintain context integrity during procedure execution
- Support loading of multiple related procedure files
- Handle file loading errors gracefully

### Debug Mode Enhancements
- Track all loaded context files during procedure execution
- Display loaded files in a clear, organized format
- Provide context file loading history
- Support context file validation and verification

### Context Retention
- Maintain loaded context throughout procedure execution
- Ensure context is available for all procedure steps
- Support context sharing between related procedures
- Handle context cleanup appropriately

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria are met and tested
- [ ] Procedure recognition works with various plain language request formats
- [ ] File loading mechanism is reliable and consistent
- [ ] Debug mode accurately tracks and displays context files
- [ ] No regression in existing explicit command functionality
- [ ] User acceptance testing completed successfully
- [ ] Documentation updated to reflect new capabilities
- [ ] Code review completed and approved

## Dependencies

- **Blocks:** Epic 2-5 (all future epics depend on reliable agent procedure execution)
- **Depends on:** None (foundational improvement)
- **Related to:** Story 1.1 (Agent Framework), Story 1.2 (File Pipeline)

## Notes

This story addresses a critical technical debt issue that affects the reliability of the entire agent system. The current behavior where agents acknowledge plain language requests but don't load proper context creates a false sense of progress and forces users to use explicit commands. This improvement will significantly enhance user experience and workflow efficiency.

The implementation should focus on:
1. Improving procedure recognition accuracy
2. Ensuring reliable file loading
3. Maintaining backward compatibility
4. Providing clear user feedback

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Plain Language Procedure Request
1. User makes a plain language request: "I need to create a new story"
2. Agent identifies relevant procedure files (story creation, context generation, etc.)
3. Agent loads identified files into context
4. Agent executes procedure with full context
5. User receives expected result

### Scenario 2: Ambiguous Request Handling
1. User makes ambiguous request: "Help me with editing"
2. Agent identifies multiple possible procedures
3. Agent requests clarification from user
4. Agent loads appropriate files based on user response
5. Agent executes procedure successfully

### Scenario 3: Debug Mode Context Tracking
1. User activates debug mode
2. User makes procedure request
3. Debug mode displays all loaded context files
4. User can verify correct files were loaded
5. Debug mode provides context file history

## Acceptance Testing

- [ ] Test with various plain language request formats
- [ ] Test procedure recognition accuracy
- [ ] Test file loading reliability
- [ ] Test debug mode functionality
- [ ] Test context retention across procedures
- [ ] Test backward compatibility with explicit commands
- [ ] Test error handling and fallback mechanisms
- [ ] Test user feedback and clarification requests
