# Story 1.2: Basic Context Generation

## Story Information
- **Epic**: 1 - Foundation & Core Infrastructure
- **Story Number**: 1.2
- **Status**: Complete
- **Created**: 2024-12-19
- **Last Modified**: 2024-12-19

## Story Statement

As a **parent creating bedtime stories**,
I want **to use the `/muse` command to generate basic story context**,
so that **I can start the story creation process with essential information**.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **`/muse` command accepts user input** for story ideas and basic requirements
2. **External LLM follows Muse prompt rules** to generate context YAML file with basic structure including entities, plot, morals, and metadata
3. **User can specify target audience age** and story length requirements through prompt-driven interaction
4. **Basic plot template selection is available** (Hero's Journey, Pixar method, Golden Circle) via prompt rules
5. **LLM saves context file** to contexts/ directory with timestamp per prompt instructions
6. **Metadata is properly formatted** and includes all required fields as specified in prompt rules
7. **User receives confirmation** of context file creation with file path from LLM response

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.1 established the basic project structure and agent framework. The command router system is functional and can handle slash commands. The file pipeline structure is in place with template files.

### Data Models
Based on architecture documentation, the following data structures will be implemented:

**StoryContext Interface** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#Core Data Structures]:
```typescript
interface StoryContext {
  title: string;
  target_audience: {
    age_range: string;
    reading_level: string;
  };
  target_length: {
    min_words: number;
    max_words: number;
    final_target: number;
  };
  entities: {
    characters: EntityReference[];
    locations: EntityReference[];
    items: EntityReference[];
  };
  plot_template: string; // 'heroes_journey', 'pixar', 'golden_circle'
  plot_points: PlotPoint[];
  location_progression: LocationTransition[];
  morals: string[];
  themes: string[];
  metadata: {
    created_at: string;
    last_modified: string;
    version: number;
  };
}
```

### File Locations
Based on the source tree structure [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#Project Structure]:

**Required Files to Create/Modify:**
- `src/agents/museAgent.ts` - Muse agent implementation
- `contexts/` - Directory for generated context files (already exists)
- `.jester/templates/context.yaml` - Context template (already exists from Story 1.1)

### Technical Constraints
**Tech Stack Requirements** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Core Technologies]:
- **Runtime**: Node.js with TypeScript
- **Package Manager**: npm
- **File System**: Node.js fs module with fs-extra
- **Dependencies**: @types/node, axios, yaml, fs-extra, git-js

**Coding Standards** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#TypeScript Standards]:
- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Prefer interfaces over types for object shapes
- Use explicit return types for public methods
- Follow camelCase for variables and functions
- Use PascalCase for classes and interfaces

**Error Handling** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Error Handling]:
- Use try-catch blocks for async operations
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Log errors with context information
- Graceful degradation for non-critical failures

### Agent Framework Requirements
**Architecture Pattern** [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#System Overview]:
- **Agent-based file pipeline** with external knowledge graph integration
- **Command-line interface** with slash commands
- **File-Based Pipeline**: Agents communicate through structured files (YAML, Markdown)
- **Prompt-Based Agents**: All agent behavior defined through structured prompts, no custom code

**Required Agent Commands** [Source: epic-1-foundation-core-infrastructure.md#Story 1.2]:
- `/muse` - Context generation command

### Plot Templates
Based on the acceptance criteria, need to implement three plot templates:
1. **Hero's Journey** - Classic monomyth structure
2. **Pixar Method** - Character-driven storytelling approach
3. **Golden Circle** - Why-How-What narrative structure

### Debug Log References
- TypeScript strict mode compatibility issues resolved
- Jest mocking configuration fixed for fs-extra
- Command parsing quote handling working correctly
- File system operations properly mocked in tests

### Challenges Encountered
1. **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Required careful handling of undefined values and type safety
2. **Jest Mocking**: Complex mocking setup for fs-extra library functions
3. **Command Parsing**: Quote handling in command arguments needed adjustment
4. **Interface Design**: Balancing flexibility with type safety in options interface

### Lessons Learned
1. TypeScript strict mode requires explicit handling of undefined values
2. Jest mocking of complex libraries needs careful type handling
3. Command parsing should handle quoted arguments consistently
4. Interface design should balance flexibility with type safety
5. Comprehensive testing is essential for complex agent functionality
