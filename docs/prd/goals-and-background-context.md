# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Enable parents to create consistent, personalized bedtime stories through a structured three-stage workflow
- Maintain character continuity and entity relationships across multiple stories using LightRAG integration
- Provide AI-assisted story creation while preserving the collaborative human creative process
- Create a growing library of interconnected stories that evolve with children's development
- Establish a sustainable workflow that parents can use regularly without technical barriers
- Demonstrate measurable improvement in story consistency compared to unstructured approaches

## Background Context

jester addresses a critical gap in current bedtime story creation tools. While existing solutions focus on either pre-written stories lacking personalization or simple AI generation missing the collaborative element, parents need a system that provides structure without constraining creativity. The current unstructured approach leads to character inconsistencies, repetitive content, and lost story elements over time.

jester adapts proven software development methodologies (BMAD principles) to create a structured, three-stage storytelling workflow. The system uses specialized AI agents for context gathering and story generation, integrated with LightRAG knowledge graphs to ensure entity consistency and suggest meaningful connections. This approach enables parents to build rich, interconnected story universes that grow with their children while maintaining the collaborative creative process they value.
