2. **Bidirectional linking is maintained** between related entities
3. **Link validation detects** broken or missing entity references
4. **Link suggestions are provided** when creating new entity relationships
5. **Entity relationship mapping** shows connected entities and their connections
6. **Link integrity is preserved** when entities are renamed or moved
7. **Cross-entity references work** across different entity types (characters, locations, items)

## Story 2.3: Entity Creation and Management

As a **parent building a story universe**,
I want **to easily create and manage entity files**,
so that **I can build a rich knowledge base for my stories**.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. **New entity creation** prompts for required information and generates files
2. **Entity editing** allows modification of existing entity information
3. **Entity deletion** removes files and updates all references
4. **Entity search** finds entities by name, type, or content
5. **Entity listing** shows all entities organized by type and directory
6. **Entity validation** ensures consistency and completeness
7. **Entity backup** creates copies before major changes

## Story 2.4: Entity Integration with Story Generation

As a **parent creating bedtime stories**,
I want **the story generation to use my entity files**,
so that **my stories maintain consistency with my established story universe**.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. **Story generation reads** entity files from local directories
2. **Entity information is integrated** into story context and generation
3. **Character consistency** is maintained across all generated stories
4. **Location details** are used consistently in story descriptions
5. **Item references** are accurate and consistent with entity definitions
6. **Entity relationships** influence story plot and character interactions
7. **Generated stories reference** existing entities using proper [[links]]

## Story 2.5: Entity Relationship Discovery

As a **parent building a story universe**,
I want **to discover new relationships between entities**,
so that **I can create more complex and interconnected stories**.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. **Relationship suggestions** are provided based on entity content and context
2. **Entity connection mapping** shows potential relationships between entities
3. **Relationship validation** ensures suggested connections make sense
4. **Relationship creation** automatically updates both entity files
5. **Relationship browsing** allows exploration of entity connections
6. **Relationship statistics** show entity usage and connection patterns
7. **Relationship export** provides data for external analysis
