# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

jester provides an intuitive, conversational interface that feels natural to parents creating bedtime stories. The system should feel like collaborating with a knowledgeable storytelling partner who understands your family's unique story universe. The command-line interface should be approachable and engaging, with clear prompts and helpful suggestions that guide users through the creative process without overwhelming them.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Hierarchical Commands**: Clear, organized slash commands (`/jester`, `/write`, `/muse`, `/edit`, `/delete`, `/approve`, `/publish`, `/import`, `/search`) that provide contextual guidance
- **Interactive Dialogue**: The `/muse` agent engages in back-and-forth conversation to explore ideas and discover connections
- **File-Based Workflow**: Clear visual feedback through file creation and modification in the IDE
- **Contextual Help**: Built-in guidance and examples that appear when needed
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Information revealed gradually as users become more comfortable with the system

## Core Screens and Views

- **Command Interface**: Primary interaction point for all agent commands
- **File Explorer**: IDE file tree showing context.yaml, outline.md, and story.md files
- **Story Library**: Directory view of generated stories organized by date or theme
- **Entity Management Query Results**: Display of entity connections and relationships discovered
- **Edit Interface**: In-place editing capabilities for outlines and stories

## Accessibility: None

jester is designed for personal use by tech-savvy parents in IDE environments, with command-line interface optimized for efficiency and developer workflows.

## Branding

- **Playful yet Professional**: The "jester" name reflects the playful, creative nature of storytelling while maintaining the systematic approach of the tool
- **Clean and Minimal**: Interface design should be unobtrusive, letting the creative content shine
- **Family-Friendly**: Visual elements should feel warm and approachable, suitable for bedtime story creation

## Target Device and Platforms: Cross-Platform

- **Primary**: IDE environments (Cursor, VS Code) with command-line interface
- **Secondary**: Terminal/command-line applications on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Future**: Potential web interface for easier access (post-MVP)
