# Epic 3: LightRAG Integration

**Epic Goal**: Implement basic LightRAG integration for relationship discovery and entity connections while maintaining local entity files as the primary source of truth. This epic delivers essential AI-powered relationship discovery that enhances the story universe without replacing the local file management system.
