# Epic 3: LightRAG Integration

**Epic Goal**: Implement MCP integration with LightRAG for relationship discovery and entity connections while maintaining local entity files as the primary source of truth. This epic delivers the AI-powered relationship discovery that enhances the story universe without replacing the local file management system.

## Story 3.1: LightRAG MCP Client Setup

As a **developer implementing jester**,
I want **to establish LightRAG MCP integration**,
so that **the system can query the knowledge graph for relationship discovery**.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. **MCP client is implemented** in Python for LightRAG communication
2. **Connection configuration** allows specification of LightRAG endpoint and credentials
3. **Query interface** provides methods for entity and relationship queries
4. **Error handling** manages connection failures and query errors gracefully
5. **Response parsing** converts LightRAG responses to usable data structures
6. **Connection testing** verifies LightRAG accessibility and functionality
7. **Configuration validation** ensures proper MCP client setup

## Story 3.2: Entity Relationship Discovery

As a **parent building a story universe**,
I want **to discover new entity relationships through LightRAG**,
so that **I can find connections I might have missed in my local files**.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. **LightRAG queries** search for entities similar to local entities
2. **Relationship suggestions** are generated based on LightRAG knowledge graph
3. **Entity connections** are discovered between local and LightRAG entities
4. **Relationship confidence** scores indicate the strength of suggested connections
5. **Relationship filtering** allows filtering by entity type and connection strength
6. **Relationship export** saves discovered connections for local use
7. **Relationship validation** ensures suggested connections make sense

## Story 3.3: LightRAG Query Integration

As a **parent creating bedtime stories**,
I want **the system to query LightRAG for relevant entities**,
so that **my stories can include discovered characters, locations, and items**.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. **Context generation** queries LightRAG for relevant entities during `/muse` command
2. **Entity suggestions** are provided based on story context and requirements
3. **Entity filtering** allows selection of relevant entities from LightRAG results
4. **Entity integration** incorporates selected entities into local story context
5. **Entity validation** ensures suggested entities fit the story requirements
6. **Entity export** saves selected entities to local entity files
7. **Query optimization** minimizes LightRAG queries while maximizing relevance

## Story 3.4: LightRAG Data Synchronization

As a **parent maintaining a story universe**,
I want **to sync local entity changes with LightRAG**,
so that **my knowledge graph stays updated with my story universe**.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. **Manual sync trigger** allows user to initiate LightRAG updates
2. **Entity export** sends local entity changes to LightRAG
3. **Sync validation** ensures data integrity before and after sync
4. **Sync logging** tracks what changes were sent to LightRAG
5. **Sync conflict resolution** handles conflicts between local and LightRAG data
6. **Sync rollback** allows undoing sync operations if needed
7. **Sync status** shows current sync state and pending changes

## Story 3.5: LightRAG Query Optimization

As a **parent using jester regularly**,
I want **LightRAG queries to be efficient and cost-effective**,
so that **the system remains practical for regular use**.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. **Query caching** stores frequently used LightRAG responses locally
2. **Query batching** combines multiple queries to reduce LightRAG calls
3. **Query optimization** uses the most efficient LightRAG query types
4. **Cost tracking** monitors LightRAG usage and costs
5. **Query limits** prevent excessive LightRAG usage
6. **Offline mode** allows operation without LightRAG when needed
7. **Performance monitoring** tracks query response times and success rates
