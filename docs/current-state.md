# Current State - Prompt-Based Agent System

## ✅ What's Working

### Agent System
- **Agent Loader**: Reads YAML configs from `.jester/agents/*.md`
- **Agent Executor**: Routes CLI commands to appropriate agents
- **Command Parsing**: Handles `/muse`, `/write`, `/edit`, `/entity` commands
- **Response System**: Structured responses with next steps and error handling

### CLI Integration
- **Help System**: Dynamic help generated from agent definitions
- **Command Execution**: Real agent responses (not placeholders)
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with suggestions

### Agent Definitions
- **Muse Agent**: Story context generation with prompts
- **Write Agent**: Outline and story generation workflows
- **Edit Agent**: Content editing and refinement
- **Entity Agent**: Character, location, item management

## 🔧 Current Architecture

```
CLI Command → Agent Executor → Agent Loader → Agent Definition → Response
     ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓
  /muse        Route to Muse    Load muse.md   Execute behavior
  /write       Route to Write   Load write.md  rules & prompts
  /edit        Route to Edit    Load edit.md
  /entity      Route to Entity  Load entity.md
```

## 📁 File Structure

```
src/agents/
├── agentLoader.ts      ✅ YAML parsing, agent discovery
├── agentExecutor.ts    ✅ Command routing, response handling
└── [fileOperations.ts] ❌ Pending - actual file operations

.jester/templates/

├── character.md       ❌ Missing - needed for entity creation

## 🚀 How to Test Current System

```bash
# Test agent loading and help
jester

# Test Muse agent (creates placeholder response)
jester /muse "A brave little mouse goes on an adventure"

# Test Write agent (creates placeholder response)  
jester /write outline

# Test Entity agent (creates placeholder response)
jester /entity create character "Brave Mouse"

# Test Edit agent (creates placeholder response)
jester /edit "story.md" "replace: title -> New Title"
```

## 🔄 Current Workflow

1. **User runs command**: `jester /muse "story idea"`
2. **CLI parses command**: Extracts `/muse` and `"story idea"`
3. **Agent Executor routes**: Finds Muse agent
4. **Agent responds**: Returns structured response with prompts
5. **CLI displays**: Shows agent response and next steps

## ❌ What's Missing

### File Operations
- No actual file creation/reading/updating
- No context file generation
- No outline/story file creation
- No entity file management

### Templates
- Missing all template files
- No template loading system
- No template-based file generation

### External Integrations
- No LightRAG MCP client
- No entity relationship discovery
- No wiki-link system

## 🎯 Next Immediate Steps

1. **Create file operations**: Make agents actually create/read files
2. **Create templates**: Add missing template files
3. **Test end-to-end**: Verify real file operations work
4. **Add LightRAG**: Implement entity relationship discovery

## 📋 Quick Commands

```bash
# Build and test
npm run build && node dist/cli.js

# Test specific agent
node dist/cli.js /muse "test story"

# See all commands
node dist/cli.js

# Check agent loading
node dist/cli.js /help
```

## 🔍 Debug Information

- **Agent Loading**: Check console output for "Loaded agent:" messages
- **Command Parsing**: Commands are hardcoded in `agentExecutor.ts`
- **File Operations**: Currently all placeholder responses
- **Templates**: Referenced but not implemented

The system is ready for file operations implementation - the foundation is solid!
