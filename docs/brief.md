# Project Brief: jester

## Executive Summary

**jester** is an AI-powered bedtime story creation system that transforms unstructured storytelling into a structured, collaborative workflow. The system enables parents to co-create personalized bedtime stories with their children through a three-stage process: context gathering, outline development, and story generation.

**Primary Problem**: Current bedtime story creation lacks structure and consistency, making it difficult to build upon previous stories, maintain character continuity, and create age-appropriate content that grows with children over time.

**Target Market**: Parents seeking to create personalized, consistent bedtime stories for their children, with particular focus on families who want to build a rich, interconnected story universe.

**Key Value Proposition**: jester provides the structure and automation to enrich storytelling while preserving the human creative process, enabling parents to create a growing library of interconnected stories that evolve with their children's development.

## Problem Statement

**Current State and Pain Points:**
Parents creating bedtime stories face significant challenges in maintaining narrative consistency and character development across multiple stories. Without structured systems, it becomes difficult to:
- Remember character details and relationships from previous stories
- Ensure age-appropriate content that grows with children
- Build upon existing story elements without contradictions
- Track which characters, locations, or themes haven't been used recently
- Maintain the collaborative creative process while adding structure

**Impact of the Problem:**
- Stories become inconsistent or repetitive over time
- Children notice character inconsistencies, breaking immersion
- Parents struggle to create fresh content while maintaining continuity
- Valuable story elements and character development get lost or forgotten
- The creative process becomes more frustrating than enjoyable

**Why Existing Solutions Fall Short:**
Current bedtime story apps and tools focus on either:
- Pre-written stories (lacking personalization and continuity)
- Simple AI generation (missing the collaborative human element)
- Complex story creation tools (overwhelming for casual use)
- None provide the structured workflow needed for ongoing story universe development

**Urgency and Importance:**
Bedtime stories are crucial for child development, family bonding, and creating lasting memories. The window for creating these shared experiences is limited, and parents need tools that enhance rather than complicate this precious time.

## Proposed Solution

**Core Concept and Approach:**
jester adapts proven software development methodologies (specifically BMAD principles) to create a structured, three-stage bedtime story creation workflow. The system uses specialized AI agents with distinct roles: a context-gathering agent (`/muse`) that collaborates with parents to explore ideas and discover entity connections, and a generation agent (`/write`) that creates outlines and stories from structured inputs.

**Key Differentiators from Existing Solutions:**
- **Collaborative AI Partnership**: Unlike pre-written stories or pure AI generation, jester maintains the human creative process while adding AI assistance
- **Structured Workflow**: Three distinct stages (context → outline → story) with clear handoffs and quality gates
- **Entity Continuity**: LightRAG knowledge graph integration ensures character consistency and suggests meaningful connections
- **Adaptive Complexity**: System grows with children through entity evolution and age-appropriate content generation
- **File-Based Pipeline**: Clean separation of concerns with YAML context files, Markdown outlines, and final stories

**Why This Solution Will Succeed:**
jester addresses the core tension between creativity and consistency by providing structure without constraining the creative process. The specialized agent approach allows for deep expertise in different aspects of storytelling, while the file-based pipeline ensures clean handoffs and prevents context bleeding between stages.

**High-Level Vision:**
jester becomes the go-to system for parents who want to create rich, interconnected story universes that grow with their children. The system evolves from a simple story generator into a comprehensive storytelling companion that suggests connections, tracks character development, and adapts to changing family needs over time.
