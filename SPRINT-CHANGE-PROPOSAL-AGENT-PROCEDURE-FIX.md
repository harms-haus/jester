# Sprint Change Proposal: Agent Procedure Recognition & File Loading Fix

## Analysis Summary

### Original Issue
Agents acknowledge plain language requests for procedures but fail to load the correct procedure files into context, creating a false sense of progress followed by incomplete execution. This forces users to use explicit commands to get proper file loading, reducing workflow efficiency and user trust in the system.

### Analyzed Impact
- **Epic Impact:** Foundational technical debt affecting Epic 1 (Foundation & Core Infrastructure)
- **Artifact Impact:** Requires updates to PRD (agent reliability requirements) and Architecture (file loading mechanism)
- **MVP Impact:** No scope changes - this is a technical improvement to existing functionality
- **Downstream Impact:** All future epics depend on reliable agent procedure execution

### Rationale for Chosen Path
**Option 1: Direct Adjustment** was selected because:
- This is a technical improvement, not a scope change
- High feasibility with medium effort
- Low risk - improves existing functionality
- No rollback needed - this is foundational debt that must be fixed
- No MVP scope reduction needed

## Specific Proposed Edits

### 1. New Story Addition to Epic 1

**Add to Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure**

**Story 1.7: Agent Procedure Recognition & File Loading Reliability**

**As a** user of the jester system  
**I want** agents to properly recognize and load relevant procedure files when I make plain language requests  
**So that** I can get reliable procedure execution without having to use explicit commands

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Agents can identify relevant procedure files from plain language requests
- [ ] Agents load the correct files into context before executing procedures
- [ ] Debug mode properly tracks and displays loaded context files
- [ ] Plain language requests result in the same reliable execution as explicit commands
- [ ] System maintains context retention across procedure execution
- [ ] User receives clear feedback about what files were loaded and why

**Priority:** High (blocks Epic 2-5 completion)  
**Effort:** Medium  
**Dependencies:** None

### 2. PRD Updates

**Add to Section 3.1 Functional Requirements:**

**FR1.1: Agent Reliability Requirements**
- The system shall ensure agents properly identify and load relevant procedure files from user requests
- The system shall provide reliable procedure execution regardless of whether users use explicit commands or plain language
- The system shall maintain proper context retention during procedure execution
- The system shall provide clear feedback about loaded context files when requested

### 3. Architecture Document Updates

**Add to Section 2.1 Core Principles:**

**9. Agent Procedure Recognition:** Agents must reliably identify and load relevant procedure files from user requests, ensuring consistent execution regardless of request format (explicit commands vs. plain language).

**Add to Section 3.2 Agent Framework:**

**File Loading Mechanism:**
- Agents shall analyze user requests to identify relevant procedure files
- Agents shall load identified files into context before executing procedures
- Debug mode shall track and display all loaded context files
- Context retention shall be maintained throughout procedure execution
- Fallback mechanisms shall ensure reliable execution even with ambiguous requests

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Story Creation & Documentation Updates
- [x] Create Story 1.7 in Epic 1
- [x] Update PRD with agent reliability requirements
- [x] Update Architecture document with file loading mechanism details

### Phase 2: Technical Implementation
- [ ] Implement improved procedure recognition logic
- [ ] Enhance file loading mechanism
- [ ] Improve debug mode context tracking
- [ ] Test with various plain language request formats

### Phase 3: Validation & Testing
- [ ] Validate procedure recognition accuracy
- [ ] Test context retention across different scenarios
- [ ] Verify debug mode functionality
- [ ] User acceptance testing

## Success Criteria

- Users can make plain language requests and receive reliable procedure execution
- Agents consistently load correct procedure files into context
- Debug mode accurately tracks and displays loaded context
- No regression in explicit command functionality
- Improved user experience and workflow efficiency

## Risk Mitigation

- **Risk:** Changes to agent behavior might break existing functionality
- **Mitigation:** Maintain backward compatibility with explicit commands
- **Risk:** Procedure recognition might be too aggressive or too conservative
- **Mitigation:** Implement configurable recognition thresholds and user feedback mechanisms

## Next Steps

1. **PO (Sarah):** Story creation and documentation updates (completed)
2. **PM:** Review and approve story addition to Epic 1
3. **Architect:** Review technical approach for procedure recognition implementation
4. **Development:** Implement the technical improvements
5. **QA:** Test and validate the improvements
