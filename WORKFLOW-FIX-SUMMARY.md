# Command Structure Standardization Summary

## Issue Resolved
**Problem**: The Jester system had a verbose and non-contextual command structure that didn't provide clear guidance to users. The system was "very wordy but doesn't actually help" and lacked proper context for users.

## Root Cause
The original system used a workflow-based approach with multiple agents that didn't provide clear, hierarchical command structure. Users found it difficult to navigate and understand what commands were available and when to use them.

## Solution Implemented
**New Hierarchical Command Structure**: Implemented a clean, intuitive command system with 9 main commands and clear sub-commands that provide contextual guidance to users.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Documentation
- ✅ **PRD (Product Requirements Document)**: Updated to reflect new command structure
- ✅ **Architecture Document**: Updated to align with new command hierarchy
- ✅ **README Files**: Updated main README and framework README
- ✅ **Import Staging README**: Updated workflow references

### 2. Created New Agent Files
- ✅ **jester.md**: Main entry point with init and help commands
- ✅ **write.md**: Story generation (context, outline, story)
- ✅ **muse.md**: Brainstorming (create-new, explore-existing, list-elicitations)
- ✅ **edit.md**: Content editing (character/location/item editing, general editing)
- ✅ **delete.md**: Entity removal (character/location/item/story deletion)
- ✅ **approve.md**: Draft approval to ready stage
- ✅ **publish.md**: Story publishing with entities and patches
- ✅ **import.md**: Content import from files or directories
- ✅ **search.md**: Search local files and LightRAG database

### 3. Updated Prompt Files
- ✅ **workflow-selection.md**: Updated to reference new command structure
- ✅ **user-greeting.md**: Updated to use new commands
- ✅ **project-initialization.md**: Updated workflow guidance
- ✅ **Created new prompt files**: story-generation.md, metadata-propagation.md, plot-templates.md, brainstorming-techniques.md, search-queries.md

### 4. Updated Template Files
- ✅ **workflow-menu.yaml**: Completely restructured to command-based system
- ✅ **Created new template files**: context-template.yaml, outline-template.md, story-template.md, brainstorming-session.yaml, edit-template.yaml, patch-template.yaml, search-template.yaml, result-template.yaml, import-template.yaml, validation-template.yaml, approval-template.yaml, validation-checklist.yaml, publish-template.yaml, deletion-confirmation.yaml

## New Command Structure

### ✅ NEW Command Structure
1. **Main Entry Point**: 
   - `/jester` - Main entry point with init and help commands

2. **Content Generation**: 
   - `/write` - Story generation (context, outline, story)
   - `/muse` - Brainstorming (create-new, explore-existing, list-elicitations)

3. **Content Management**: 
   - `/edit` - Content editing (character/location/item editing, general editing)
   - `/delete` - Entity removal (character/location/item/story deletion)
   - `/search` - Search local files and LightRAG database

4. **Workflow Management**: 
   - `/approve` - Draft approval to ready stage
   - `/publish` - Story publishing with entities and patches
   - `/import` - Content import from files or directories

### ✅ Benefits of New Structure
1. **Clear Hierarchy**: Commands are organized logically with clear purposes
2. **Contextual Guidance**: Each command provides specific, actionable guidance
3. **Reduced Verbosity**: System is concise and focused on user needs
4. **Better Navigation**: Users can easily find and use the right commands

## Files Modified
- **Documentation**: `docs/prd.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, `README.md`, `jester-story-framework/README.md`, `import-staging/README.md`
- **Agent Files**: All 9 new agent files in `.jester/agents/`
- **Prompt Files**: Updated existing prompts and created new ones
- **Template Files**: Updated workflow-menu.yaml and created 15 new template files
- **System Files**: Updated various README and summary files

## Next Steps
1. Test the new command structure with users
2. Verify all commands work as expected
3. Gather feedback on the new hierarchical structure
4. Make any necessary refinements based on user experience
