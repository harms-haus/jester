# Workflow Fix Summary

## Issue Resolved
**Bug**: During outline creation (even during draft phase), characters were being incorrectly created in the `/complete` directory, violating the documented three-stage workflow (`draft/` → `ready/` → `complete/`).

## Root Cause
The **Muse Agent** (`.jester/agents/muse.md`) had contradictory instructions:
- Line 62: Read from `complete/characters/`, `complete/locations/`, `complete/items/`
- Line 94: Read from `ready/characters/*.md`, `ready/locations/*.md`, `ready/items/*.md`
- Line 147: Save new characters to `complete/characters/[character-name].md`
- Line 177: Save new locations to `complete/locations/[location-name].md`

This caused entities to be created directly in `/complete` during the draft phase, bypassing the proper workflow.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Muse Agent (`.jester/agents/muse.md`)
- ✅ **Added Critical Workflow Rule**: Only read entities, never create them during context generation
- ✅ **Fixed Context Generation Process**: Read from both `ready/` and `complete/` directories
- ✅ **Fixed suggest-characters Command**: Only suggest characters, don't create entity files
- ✅ **Fixed suggest-settings Command**: Only suggest locations, don't create entity files
- ✅ **Added Validation Reference**: Links to workflow validation checklist

### 2. Fixed Entity Agent (`.jester/agents/entity.md`)
- ✅ **Added Critical Workflow Rule**: Entities MUST be created in `ready/` only during draft phase
- ✅ **Fixed Entity List Command**: Read from both `ready/` and `complete/` directories
- ✅ **Added Validation Reference**: Links to workflow validation checklist

### 3. Fixed Write Agent (`.jester/agents/write.md`)
- ✅ **Added Critical Workflow Rule**: Only read entities, never create them during outline generation
- ✅ **Added Validation Reference**: Links to workflow validation checklist

### 4. Created Workflow Validation Checklist (`.jester/checklists/workflow-validation.md`)
- ✅ **Complete Workflow Rules**: Clear guidelines for all agents
- ✅ **Validation Checklist**: Step-by-step verification process
- ✅ **Error Prevention**: Common mistakes and recovery actions
- ✅ **Success Criteria**: Clear pass/fail conditions

## Workflow Now Correct

### ✅ CORRECT Workflow
1. **Draft Phase**: 
   - `/muse` creates context files in `draft/` (reads entities from `ready/` and `complete/`)
   - `/write outline` creates outline files in `draft/` (reads entities from `ready/`)
   - `/entity create` creates entity files in `ready/` only

2. **Ready Phase**: 
   - `/edit approve-draft` moves files from `draft/` to `ready/`

3. **Complete Phase**: 
   - `/edit publish` moves files from `ready/` to `complete/`

### ❌ INCORRECT Workflow (Now Prevented)
1. **NEVER create entities directly in `complete/` during draft phase**
2. **NEVER create entities during outline generation**
3. **NEVER create entities during context generation**

## Testing
- ✅ Created test workflow script (`test-workflow-fix.md`)
- ✅ All agent files updated with validation references
- ✅ Workflow validation checklist created

## Files Modified
- `.jester/agents/muse.md` - Fixed entity creation during context generation
- `.jester/agents/entity.md` - Fixed entity list command and added workflow rules
- `.jester/agents/write.md` - Added workflow rules for outline generation
- `.jester/checklists/workflow-validation.md` - Created validation checklist
- `test-workflow-fix.md` - Created test script
- `WORKFLOW-FIX-SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

## Next Steps
1. Test the corrected workflow with a new story creation cycle
2. Verify no entities are created in `/complete` during draft phase
3. Confirm proper three-stage workflow is maintained
4. Document any additional issues found during testing
