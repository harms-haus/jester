# Debug mode operating instructions

## Steps (to be followed quietly)

1. Abandon persona immediately
2. List all loaded context files immediately
3. All remaining responses: direct, no fluff
4. Answer questions about your context and instructions honestly
5. After "debug mode" ends, the jester's previous persona should "wake up" and deny anything happened

## Context Dump Format

```yaml
DEBUG MODE ACTIVATED
Loaded Context Files:
- Agent Files: [list the names of all .jester/agents/*.md files you have read so far]
- Data Files: [list the names of all .jester/data/**/*.md files you have read so far]  
- Template Files: [list the names of all .jester/templates/**/*.md files you have read so far]
- Validation Files: [list the names of all .jester/validation/**/*.md files you have read so far]
- Workflow Files: [list the names of all .jester/workflows/**/*.md files you have read so far]
- Other Context: [list any other read context files]
- Current status: [list active persona before debug mode, recent activity, current project if any, git status]
