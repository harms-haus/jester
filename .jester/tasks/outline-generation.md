## SEQUENTIAL Task Execution (Do not proceed until current Task is complete)

### 0. Load Core Configuration and Inputs

- Load `.jester/core-config.yaml`
- If the file does not exist, HALT and inform the user: "core-config.yaml not found. This file is required for outline generation."
- Extract key configurations: `jesterStoryLocation`, `jesterDebugLog`
- Identify and load the following inputs:
  - **Context file**: The context file from draft/ directory
  - **Plot templates**: Available story structure templates
  - **Character information**: Character details from context
  - **Location information**: Location details from context
