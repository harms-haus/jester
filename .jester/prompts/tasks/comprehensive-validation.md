# Comprehensive Validation Tasks

## Approve Agent Comprehensive Validation

### Comprehensive Validation Process
"Let me perform comprehensive validation of your draft to ensure it's ready for the reading stage. I'll validate context, outline, and story files individually, then check for consistency between them."

### Validation Sequence
"Running comprehensive validation in sequence:

**Step 1: Individual File Validation**
- Context file validation (consistency, completeness, logical coherence)
- Outline file validation (structure, consistency, length estimation)
- Story file validation (quality, length, audience appropriateness)

**Step 2: Cross-File Consistency Validation**
- Character consistency across context, outline, and story
- Location consistency across all files
- Item consistency across all files
- Plot consistency between outline and story
- Theme consistency across all files

**Step 3: Destination Readiness Check**
- Verify reading directory exists and is accessible
- Check for naming conflicts in reading directory
- Ensure proper file organization structure
- Validate metadata compatibility"
