- Use location template format from .jester/templates/location-template.md
- Store in reading/{NNN} - Story Title/locations/ directory

- Create individual location patch files for each existing location in context with any new information, otherwise skip this step
- Use git-patch-like format

**Step 4: Item File Creation**
- Create individual item files for each newly-created item in context
- Use item template format from .jester/templates/item-template.md
- Store in reading/{NNN} - Story Title/items/ directory
