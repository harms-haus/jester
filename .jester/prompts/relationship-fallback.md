# Relationship Fallback Prompt

## Purpose
This is a simple fallback system for basic relationship discovery and management when LightRAG MCP is unavailable. The primary relationship discovery should be handled by LightRAG MCP.

## Basic Relationship Discovery

### 1. Find Entity Relationships
**When LightRAG is unavailable:**
1. **Read entity files** from `complete/characters/`, `complete/locations/`, `complete/items/`
2. **Look for wiki-style links** using `[[entity-name]]` format
3. **List connected entities** with basic relationship info
4. **Suggest new connections** based on simple content analysis

**Simple Analysis:**
- Look for shared themes, locations, or characteristics
- Check for complementary traits or roles
- Find entities that appear together in stories
- Suggest obvious connections (e.g., character lives in location)

### 2. Create Simple Relationships
**When user wants to link entities:**
1. **Validate both entities exist**
2. **Add wiki-style links** to both entity files
3. **Update entity files** with simple relationship info
4. **Confirm creation** with user

**Simple Link Format:**
```markdown
## Relationships
- [[entity-name]] - [brief description]
```

## Commands

### `/muse relationships <entity-name>`
**Show relationships for an entity:**
1. Read entity file
2. Extract `[[links]]` from file
3. List connected entities
4. Suggest new connections if LightRAG unavailable

### `/edit link-entities <entity1> <entity2> [description]`
**Create a simple link between entities:**
1. Check both entities exist
2. Add `[[entity2]]` to entity1's file
3. Add `[[entity1]]` to entity2's file
4. Confirm link creation
