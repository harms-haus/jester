# Entity Import Prompts

## Directory Processing Prompts

### Directory Scan and File Selection
```
Scan the specified directory and select up to 10 .md files for import processing:

**Directory Path:** {{DIRECTORY_PATH}}
**Entity Type Filter:** {{ENTITY_TYPE_FILTER}} (optional)

**Selection Criteria:**
1. Find all .md files in the directory (and subdirectories if specified)
2. Filter out files that are already structured (contain template headers)
3. Filter by entity type if specified (character, location, item)
4. Select up to 10 files for processing
5. Prioritize files that appear to be unstructured entity descriptions

**File Analysis Instructions:**
- Check if file contains structured template headers (Basic Information, Description, etc.)
- Look for entity-like content (names, descriptions, properties)
- Avoid files that are clearly stories, outlines, or other non-entity content
- Prioritize files with entity names in the filename

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "total_files_found": number,
  "files_selected": [
    {
      "file_path": "string",
      "entity_type": "character|location|item|unknown",
      "confidence": "high|medium|low",
      "reason": "string"
    }
  ],
  "files_skipped": [
    {
      "file_path": "string",
      "reason": "already_structured|not_entity|low_confidence"
    }
  ],
  "processing_order": ["file_path1", "file_path2", ...]
}
```
```

### Batch Processing Progress
```
Track the progress of batch import processing:

**Batch Details:**
- **Total Files**: {{TOTAL_FILES}}
- **Files Processed**: {{FILES_PROCESSED}}
- **Files Remaining**: {{FILES_REMAINING}}
- **Current File**: {{CURRENT_FILE}}

**Progress Status:**
- **Current Step**: {{CURRENT_STEP}}
- **Success Count**: {{SUCCESS_COUNT}}
- **Error Count**: {{ERROR_COUNT}}
- **Skipped Count**: {{SKIPPED_COUNT}}

**Progress Instructions:**
1. Show current file being processed
2. Display overall progress percentage
3. List any errors encountered so far
4. Show estimated time remaining
5. Provide option to continue or stop

**Response Format:**
```
Processing file {{CURRENT_FILE}} ({{FILES_PROCESSED}}/{{TOTAL_FILES}})
Progress: {{PROGRESS_PERCENTAGE}}%
Status: {{CURRENT_STEP}}

‚úÖ Successfully processed: {{SUCCESS_COUNT}} files
‚ùå Errors encountered: {{ERROR_COUNT}} files
‚è≠Ô∏è Skipped: {{SKIPPED_COUNT}} files

{{ERROR_DETAILS_IF_ANY}}
```
```

### Duplicate Detection
```
Detect and handle duplicate files during directory import:

**Directory Contents:** {{DIRECTORY_FILES}}
**Existing Entities:** {{EXISTING_ENTITIES}}

**Duplicate Detection Rules:**
1. Check if file name matches existing entity file
2. Check if content is similar to existing structured entities
3. Check if file is already in structured format
4. Identify files that are clearly duplicates or variations

**Detection Instructions:**
- Compare file names (case-insensitive, normalized)
- Check for similar entity names in content
- Look for template structure indicators
- Identify files that are clearly the same entity

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "duplicates_found": [
    {
      "file_path": "string",
      "existing_entity": "string",
      "similarity_score": number,
      "reason": "same_name|similar_content|already_structured"
    }
  ],
  "files_to_process": ["file_path1", "file_path2", ...],
  "files_to_skip": ["file_path1", "file_path2", ...]
}
```
```

## Content Analysis Prompts

### Entity Type Detection
```

- Atmosphere, mood, or setting details
- Inhabitants or entities that reside there
- Historical significance or backstory

**Item indicators:**
- Object names or item references
- Physical properties or characteristics
- Function, purpose, or special abilities
- Rarity, value, or significance
- History or origin details

Content to analyze:
{{FILE_CONTENT}}

Respond with: CHARACTER, LOCATION, or ITEM
```

6. Extract relationship information and create appropriate references
7. Look for backstory or historical context
8. Identify any story appearances or usage references

**Template Fields to Populate:**
{{TEMPLATE_FIELDS}}

### Content Enrichment
```
Enhance the following extracted entity information to create a rich, detailed character/location/item description:

**Original Content:**
{{ORIGINAL_CONTENT}}

**Extracted Information:**
{{EXTRACTED_INFO}}

**Enrichment Instructions:**
