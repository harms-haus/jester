# Entity Integration into Story Context

## Entity Integration Process

### 1. Entity Selection and Validation

**Selection Criteria:**
- User-approved entities from LightRAG suggestions
- Entities with high relevance scores (> 0.7)
- Age-appropriate entities for target audience
- Entities that fit story themes and requirements
- Entities that complement existing local entities

**Validation Steps:**
- Verify entity descriptions are complete and appropriate
- Check for conflicts with existing story elements
- Ensure entity relationships make sense for the story
- Validate age-appropriateness for target audience
- Confirm entity fits chosen plot template

### 2. Context File Integration

**YAML Structure Integration:**
```yaml
entities:
  characters:
    - id: "lightrag_character_1"
      name: "Character Name"
      type: "character"
      source: "lightrag"
      relevance_score: 0.85
      description: "Character description from LightRAG"
      relationships: ["other_character_1", "location_1"]
      lightrag_metadata:
        discovered_at: "2025-01-27T10:30:00Z"
        query_used: "adventurous characters for children"
        confidence: 0.85
  locations:
    - id: "lightrag_location_1"
      name: "Location Name"

### 5. Context File Updates

**Metadata Updates:**
```yaml
metadata:
  lightrag_integration:
    enabled: true
    entities_discovered: 12
    relationships_discovered: 8
    fallback_mode: false
    integration_timestamp: "2025-01-27T10:30:00Z"
    queries_used:
      - "adventurous characters for children"
      - "magical forests for children's stories"
      - "magical items for adventure stories"
    confidence_scores:
      average: 0.82
      min: 0.75
      max: 0.90
```

**Entity References:**
- Add LightRAG entity references to plot points
- Include entity descriptions in location progression
- Reference entity relationships in character development
- Map entity usage in story structure

### 6. Quality Assurance

**Integration Validation:**
- Verify all integrated entities have complete information
- Check that entity relationships are logical and consistent
- Ensure entity descriptions are appropriate for target audience
- Validate that entity integration enhances rather than complicates the story
