# Muse Agent - Creative Brainstorming

## Purpose

The Muse agent facilitates creative brainstorming and context gathering for story creation. It engages users in interactive dialogue to explore ideas, discover connections, and generate rich context for bedtime stories.

## Commands

### `/muse create-new`
Initiates a new brainstorming session for a universe new story:
- Asks about story themes, characters, and settings
- Explores plot ideas and moral lessons
- Discovers connections to existing story universe
- **LightRAG Integration**: Queries LightRAG for relevant entities and relationships
- **Entity Suggestions**: Presents discovered entities for user selection
- **Entity Integration**: Incorporates selected entities into story context
- Generates a structured context file at the end of the session
- Saves context to `draft/{NNN}/` directory with story title-based filename

**IMPORTANT: Does NOT create entity files**

- Only creates the context file with entity information as structured data
- Entity files are created only after /approve command
- No individual character, location, or item files are created
- Use `/edit rename` task if entity names need to be changed after creation

## `/muse explore-existing`
Explores an existing draft to tease out new details:
- Analyzes current context, outline, or story files
- Identifies areas for expansion or clarification
- Suggests new character relationships or plot developments
- Discovers additional entity connections
- Updates existing files with new insights

## `/muse list-elicitations`
Lists various ways jester elicits details from users:
- Presents different brainstorming techniques
- Allows user to choose specific elicitation method
- Provides structured approach to creative exploration
- Examples: character interviews, world-building questions, plot exploration

## `/muse discover-relationships [entity-name]`
Discovers relationships for a specific entity using LightRAG knowledge graph:
- Validates entity exists in local files
- Queries LightRAG for similar entities and relationships
- Calculates confidence scores for discovered entities
- Generates relationship suggestions with reasoning
- Presents results with actionable recommendations

## `/muse discover-all-relationships`
Discovers relationships for all entities in the story universe:
- Scans universe/ directory for all entities
- Processes entities in batches to avoid overwhelming LightRAG
- Creates comprehensive relationship map
- Identifies potential relationship conflicts
- Generates summary report of all discoveries

## `/muse filter-relationships [options]`
Filters discovered relationships based on criteria:
- Filter by entity type (character, location, item)
- Filter by confidence range (e.g., 0.7-1.0)
- Filter by relationship type
- Filter by data source (local, lightrag, both)

## `/muse export-relationships [format] [options]`
Exports discovered relationships to specified format:
- JSON format with full metadata
- CSV format for spreadsheet analysis
- Include/exclude metadata options
- Apply filters before export

## `/muse validate-relationships`
Validates discovered relationships for consistency and accuracy:

- **Character Interviews**: Ask questions about character motivations, fears, and dreams
- **World Building**: Explore settings, cultures, and magical elements
- **Plot Exploration**: Examine conflict, resolution, and moral themes
- **Entity Discovery**: Find connections between characters, locations, and items
- **Theme Development**: Explore deeper meanings and educational value

## LightRAG Integration

The Muse agent queries LightRAG to:
- **Context Generation**: Discover relevant entities during `/muse create-new` workflow
- **Entity Suggestions**: Provide age-appropriate entity suggestions based on story context
- **Entity Integration**: Incorporate selected LightRAG entities into story context files
- **Relationship Discovery**: Find relationships between story elements
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback when LightRAG service unavailable

**LightRAG Context Integration Features:**
- Context-aware query generation based on story requirements
- Age-appropriate entity filtering and scoring
- Entity diversity balancing (character types, locations, items)
- LightRAG entity metadata preservation in context files
- Source tracking (local vs LightRAG entities)

## Output

- Plot structure and moral themes
- Target audience and length requirements
- Metadata for pipeline propagation
