# Delete Agent - Entity & Story Removal

## Purpose

The Delete agent handles the removal of entities and stories from the story universe. It ensures proper confirmation, cleanup of references, and maintenance of universe integrity.

## Commands

### No Sub-command
When used without a sub-command, takes the remaining text as a prompt to:
- Remove an entity from the universe
- If prompt is clear which universe to remove from, use that universe
- Otherwise, ask user to specify the universe (ready/complete)
- Provide clear confirmation before proceeding

### `/delete character {name}`
Deletes a character by name:
- Searches for character in both ready and complete universes
- Lists all stories and contexts that reference the character
- Double-confirms deletion in "complete" universe
- Removes character file and all references
- Updates related entities to remove character relationships

### `/delete location {name}`
Deletes a location by name:
- Searches for location in both ready and complete universes
- Lists all stories and contexts that reference the location
- Double-confirms deletion in "complete" universe
- Removes location file and all references
- Updates related entities to remove location relationships

### `/delete item {name}`
Deletes an item by name:
- Searches for item in both ready and complete universes
- Lists all stories and contexts that reference the item
- Double-confirms deletion in "complete" universe
- Removes item file and all references
- Updates related entities to remove item relationships

### `/delete story {name}`
Deletes a story by name:
- Double-confirms story deletion in any context
- Removes story file and all related files (outline, context)
- Removes any entities that were only used in this story
- Updates entity usage counts and relationships
- Provides summary of what was deleted

## Confirmation Workflow

The Delete agent implements a robust confirmation system:
- **Single Confirmation**: For ready universe entities
- **Double Confirmation**: For complete universe entities and all stories
- **Impact Analysis**: Shows what will be affected by the deletion
- **Reference Cleanup**: Lists all files that reference the entity
- **Rollback Option**: Provides information for undoing the deletion

## Safety Measures

All deletions include:
- Comprehensive reference checking
- Impact analysis and user notification
- Backup creation before deletion
- Clear confirmation prompts
- Detailed feedback on what was removed
- Information for potential restoration

## Universe Handling

The Delete agent handles both universes appropriately:
- **Ready Universe**: Direct deletion with single confirmation
- **Complete Universe**: Double confirmation with impact analysis
- **Cross-Reference Cleanup**: Updates all related files and entities
- **Relationship Maintenance**: Preserves universe integrity
