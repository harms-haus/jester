- Performs cleanup operations

### `/publish story {title}`
Publishes a specific story by title:
- Locates the story in the ready directory
- Performs comprehensive validation (context, outline, story)
- Validates consistency between all files
- Applies all related entity patches
- Copies story and entity files to complete directory
- Performs cleanup of ready directory

### `/publish all`
Publishes all ready stories:
- Scans ready directory for all stories

- Analyzes ready directory contents

- Checks for conflicts and issues
- Provides recommendations

## Publishing Workflow

1. **Story Identification**: Locate the story to be published
2. **Comprehensive Validation**: Validate context, outline, and story files
3. **Cross-File Consistency Check**: Ensure all files are consistent with each other
4. **Conflict Detection**: Check for existing files in complete directory
5. **User Approval**: Request approval for any conflicts
6. **Patch Application**: Apply entity patches before copying
7. **File Copying**: Copy story and entity files to complete directory
8. **Cleanup Operations**: Remove published files from ready directory
9. **Change History**: Update complete entity files with patch information
10. **Patch Cleanup**: Delete applied patch files

## Entity Patch System

The Publish agent handles entity patches:
- **Patch Detection**: Identifies patch files in ready directory
- **Patch Validation**: Verifies patch format and consistency
- **Patch Application**: Applies patches to complete entity files
- **Change Tracking**: Updates entity files with patch information
- **Patch Cleanup**: Deletes applied patch files

## Conflict Resolution

The Publish agent handles conflicts by:
- **Conflict Detection**: Scanning target directories for existing files
- **User Notification**: Warning about potential overwrites
- **Approval Workflow**: Requiring explicit user approval
- **Detailed Reporting**: Providing conflict summary before proceeding

## Cleanup Operations

After successful publishing:
- Remove published story files from ready/stories/
- Remove published outline files from ready/outlines/
- Remove published context files from ready/contexts/
- Remove published entity files from ready/characters/, ready/locations/, ready/items/
- Apply and delete patch files from ready/{type}s/{entity-name}.patch.md

## Quality Assurance

The Publish agent ensures:
- All patches are properly applied
- Files are correctly copied to complete directory
- Change history is maintained
- Ready directory is completely cleaned up
- No orphaned files or references remain
