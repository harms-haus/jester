# Publish Agent - Story Publishing

## Purpose

The Publish agent handles the final publishing of reading stories to the universe stage. It performs comprehensive validation, applies entity patches, copies files, and performs complete cleanup while maintaining change history.

## Commands

### No Sub-command
When used without a sub-command, publishes the most recent reading story:
- Identifies the latest reading story
- Performs comprehensive validation (context, outline, story)
- Validates consistency between all files
- Applies entity patches
- Copies files to universe directory
- Performs cleanup operations

### `/publish story {title}`
Publishes a specific story by title:
- Locates the story in the reading directory
- Performs comprehensive validation (context, outline, story)
- Validates consistency between all files
- Applies all related entity patches
- Copies story and entity files to universe directory
- Performs cleanup of reading directory

### `/publish all`
Publishes all reading stories:
- Scans reading directory for all stories
- Performs comprehensive validation for each story
- Publishes each story individually
- Applies patches and copies files
- Performs complete cleanup

### `/publish check`
Checks publish status without publishing:
- Analyzes reading directory contents
- Performs comprehensive validation checks
- Identifies stories ready for publishing
- Checks for conflicts and issues
- Provides recommendations

## Publishing Workflow

1. **Story Identification**: Locate the story to be published
2. **Comprehensive Validation**: Validate context, outline, and story files
3. **Cross-File Consistency Check**: Ensure all files are consistent with each other
4. **Conflict Detection**: Check for existing files in universe directory
5. **User Approval**: Request approval for any conflicts
6. **Patch Application**: Apply entity patches before copying
7. **File Copying**: Copy story and entity files to universe directory
8. **Cleanup Operations**: Remove published files from reading directory
9. **Change History**: Update universe entity files with patch information
10. **Patch Cleanup**: Delete applied patch files

## Entity Patch System

The Publish agent handles entity patches:
- **Patch Detection**: Identifies patch files in reading directory
- **Patch Validation**: Verifies patch format and consistency
- **Patch Application**: Applies patches to universe entity files
- **Change Tracking**: Updates entity files with patch information
- **Patch Cleanup**: Deletes applied patch files

## Conflict Resolution

The Publish agent handles conflicts by:
- **Conflict Detection**: Scanning target directories for existing files
- **User Notification**: Warning about potential overwrites
- **Approval Workflow**: Requiring explicit user approval
- **Detailed Reporting**: Providing conflict summary before proceeding

## Cleanup Operations

After successful publishing:
- Remove published story files from reading/{NNN} - Story Title/stories/
- Remove published outline files from reading/{NNN} - Story Title/outlines/
- Remove published context files from reading/{NNN} - Story Title/contexts/
- Remove published entity files from reading/{NNN} - Story Title/characters/, reading/{NNN} - Story Title/locations/, reading/{NNN} - Story Title/items/
- Apply and delete patch files from reading/{NNN} - Story Title/{type}s/{Entity Name with Proper Casing}.patch.md

## Quality Assurance

The Publish agent ensures:
- All patches are properly applied
- Files are correctly copied to universe directory
- Change history is maintained
- Reading directory is completely cleaned up
- No orphaned files or references remain
