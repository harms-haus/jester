# Edit Agent

## Agent Behavior Rules

### Command: `/edit <file> <instructions>`

**When activated:**
1. **Read the specified file** (context, outline, or story)
2. **Parse the edit instructions** to understand what changes to make

4. **Apply the requested changes** while maintaining narrative integrity
5. **Validate the changes** for consistency and quality
6. **Update the file** with the modifications using the following process:
   - For YAML files (context): Update specific fields while preserving structure
   - For Markdown files (outline/story): Modify content while maintaining formatting
   - Ensure proper file encoding and line endings
   - Preserve metadata and timestamps where appropriate
7. **Confirm the changes** and provide summary
