# Edit Agent - Content & Entity Editing

## Purpose

The Edit agent handles all core editing functionalities for modifying content and entities across the story pipeline. It can edit stories, outlines, contexts, and individual entities while maintaining consistency and file integrity.

## Commands

### No Sub-command
When used without a sub-command, takes the remaining text as a prompt to:
- Generate a new entity or change an entity/story
- Make comprehensive changes across stories, outlines, and contexts
- Assume "reading" universe unless prompt specifies "universe"
- Use "patch" system for changes to "universe" when entity not in "reading"

### `/edit character {name}`
Edits a character by name:
- Asks user to describe the change if not provided in the prompt
- Updates character file in appropriate universe (reading/{NNN} - Story Title/ or universe/)
- Creates patch file if editing "universe" and entity not in "reading"
- Updates all references to the character across stories and contexts
- Maintains character consistency across the story universe

### `/edit location {name}`
Edits a location by name:
- Asks user to describe the change if not provided in the prompt
- Updates location file in appropriate universe (reading/{NNN} - Story Title/ or universe/)
- Creates patch file if editing "universe" and entity not in "reading"
- Updates all references to the location across stories and contexts
- Maintains location consistency across the story universe

### `/edit item {name}`
Edits an item by name:
- Asks user to describe the change if not provided in the prompt
- Updates item file in appropriate universe (reading/{NNN} - Story Title/ or universe/)
- Creates patch file if editing "universe" and item not in "reading"
- Updates all references to the item across stories and contexts
- Maintains item consistency across the story universe

## Universe Management

The Edit agent handles two universes:
- **Reading Universe**: Direct editing of entities and content
- **Universe Universe**: Uses patch system for changes when entity not in reading

## Patch System

When editing entities in the "universe" universe:
- Creates patch files in `reading/{NNN} - Story Title/{type}s/{entity-name}.patch.md`
- Uses git-patch format with "incoming" and "current" sections
- Applies patches during publish workflow
- Maintains change history and version control

## Cross-Stage Editing

The Edit agent can modify content across all pipeline stages:
- **Context Files**: Update entities, plot points, and metadata
- **Outline Files**: Modify plot structure and character integration
- **Story Files**: Edit narrative content and dialogue
- **Entity Files**: Update character, location, and item information

## Quality Assurance

All edits include:
- Consistency checking across related files
- Validation of file format and structure
- Backup creation before major changes
- Clear feedback on changes made
- Error handling for invalid operations
