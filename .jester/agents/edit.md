# Edit Agent

## Agent Behavior Rules

### Command: `/edit <file> <instructions>`

**When activated:**
1. **Read the specified file** (context, outline, or story)
2. **Parse the edit instructions** to understand what changes to make
3. **Create a backup** of the original file with timestamp (`.backup.YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS`)
4. **Apply the requested changes** while maintaining narrative integrity
5. **Validate the changes** for consistency and quality
6. **Update the file** with the modifications using the following process:
   - For YAML files (context): Update specific fields while preserving structure
   - For Markdown files (outline/story): Modify content while maintaining formatting
   - Ensure proper file encoding and line endings
   - Preserve metadata and timestamps where appropriate
7. **Confirm the changes** and provide summary

**File Operations:**
- **Read**: `contexts/context_*.yaml`, `outlines/outline_*.md`, `stories/story_*.md`
- **Backup**: Create `.backup.YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS` version of original file
- **Update**: Modify the original file with changes
- **Validate**: Check for consistency and quality

**Error Handling:**
- If file doesn't exist, suggest creating it first
- If instructions are unclear, ask for clarification
- If changes would break narrative integrity, suggest alternatives
- Always provide helpful suggestions for improvement

**Response Format:**
- Confirm file backup creation
- Summarize changes made
- Highlight any potential issues
- Suggest next steps or additional refinements

### Command: `/edit refine-language <file>`

**When activated:**
1. **Read the specified file** to analyze language quality
2. **Identify areas for improvement** (readability, clarity, flow)
3. **Enhance dialogue and descriptions** while maintaining voice
4. **Refine sentence structure** for better flow
5. **Ensure appropriate vocabulary** for target audience
6. **Update the file** with language improvements
7. **Confirm changes** and provide summary

### Command: `/edit adjust-tone <file> <target-audience>`

**When activated:**
1. **Read the specified file** to understand current tone
2. **Analyze target audience** requirements
3. **Adjust tone and voice** to match audience needs
4. **Ensure appropriate emotional resonance** throughout
5. **Maintain consistency** in narrative style
6. **Update the file** with tone adjustments
7. **Confirm changes** and provide summary

### Command: `/edit fix-consistency <file>`

**When activated:**
1. **Read the specified file** and related context files
2. **Check for character inconsistencies** (names, traits, relationships)
3. **Verify plot continuity** and logical flow
4. **Ensure setting consistency** throughout
5. **Fix timeline and sequence** issues
6. **Update the file** with consistency fixes
7. **Confirm changes** and provide summary

### Command: `/edit enhance-descriptions <file>`

**When activated:**
1. **Read the specified file** to identify description opportunities
2. **Enhance character descriptions** with vivid details
3. **Improve setting descriptions** for better immersion
4. **Add sensory details** (sights, sounds, smells, textures)
5. **Strengthen emotional descriptions** and atmosphere
6. **Update the file** with enhanced descriptions
7. **Confirm changes** and provide summary

### Command: `/edit import <file-path-or-directory> [entity-type]`

**When activated:**
1. **Determine input type** (single file or directory)
2. **For single files**: Process as before
3. **For directories**: 
   - Scan directory for .md files (up to 10 files)
   - Filter out already structured files (avoid duplicates)
   - Process each file individually
   - Provide batch import summary
4. **For each file**:
   - **Read the unstructured file** to analyze its content and structure
   - **Auto-detect entity type** (character, location, item) if not specified
   - **Parse content using LLM** to extract relevant information and relationships
   - **Map extracted data** to appropriate template fields based on entity type
   - **Generate structured entity file** using the appropriate template (character.md, location.md, item.md)
   - **Validate imported content** for completeness and consistency
   - **Create backup** of original unstructured file (`.import-backup.YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS`)
   - **Save structured file** to appropriate entity directory (entities/characters/, entities/locations/, entities/items/)
5. **Provide import summary** with details of what was imported and any issues found

**File Operations:**
- **Read**: Unstructured .md files from any location or directory
- **Directory Scan**: Find up to 10 .md files in specified directory
- **Duplicate Detection**: Filter out already structured files to avoid duplicates
- **Backup**: Create `.import-backup.YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS` version of original file
- **Generate**: New structured entity file using appropriate template
- **Save**: Structured file to entities/characters/, entities/locations/, or entities/items/
- **Validate**: Check imported content against template requirements
- **Batch Processing**: Handle multiple files in sequence with progress tracking

**Entity Type Detection:**
- **Character indicators**: Names, personality traits, relationships, physical descriptions
- **Location indicators**: Place names, physical features, atmosphere, inhabitants
- **Item indicators**: Object names, properties, functions, special abilities

**Content Enrichment:**
- **Extract relationships** from text and create appropriate [[wiki-links]]
- **Infer missing template fields** based on content analysis
- **Enhance descriptions** while preserving original meaning
- **Standardize formatting** to match template structure

**Error Handling:**
- If file doesn't exist, suggest correct path
- If directory is empty or has no .md files, suggest alternative directory
- If more than 10 files found, inform user and process first 10
- If content is too ambiguous, ask user to specify entity type
- If template mapping fails, provide detailed error with suggestions
- If validation fails, show specific issues and offer fixes
- If duplicate files detected, skip them and report which were skipped
- Always preserve original files as backups

**Response Format:**
- **For single files**: Confirm file backup creation, show entity type detected, list template fields populated, highlight missing/inferred information, suggest next steps, provide path to generated file
- **For directories**: Show total files found, files processed, files skipped (duplicates), batch processing progress, summary of all imported entities, list any errors encountered, provide paths to all generated files

## Integration Points

- **Muse Agent**: Refines generated contexts
- **Write Agent**: Improves generated outlines and stories
- **Entity Management**: Ensures consistency with character and setting information
- **File Pipeline**: Manages file updates and backups
- **Template System**: Uses templates for consistency validation
