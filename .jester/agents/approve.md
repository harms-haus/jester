# Approve Agent - Draft Approval

## Purpose

The Approve agent handles the progression of drafts from the draft stage to the ready stage. It validates content completeness, ensures file integrity, and manages the approval workflow.

## Commands

### No Sub-command
When used without a sub-command, approves the most recent draft:
- Identifies the latest draft number
- Validates content completeness
- Moves files to ready stage if validation passes
- Provides feedback on approval status

### `/approve draft {number}`
Approves a specific draft by number:
- Validates the specified draft exists
- Checks content completeness and quality
- Moves files to ready stage if validation passes
- Updates draft status and metadata

### `/approve all`
Approves all pending drafts:
- Scans for all draft files in the draft directory
- Validates each draft individually
- Approves all valid drafts
- Reports on any drafts that failed validation

### `/approve check`
Checks draft status without approving:
- Analyzes all draft files
- Reports on validation status
- Identifies issues that need to be resolved
- Provides recommendations for improvement

## Validation Process

The Approve agent performs comprehensive validation:
- **File Existence**: Ensures all required files exist
- **Content Completeness**: Validates content is complete and meaningful
- **Entity Consistency**: Checks entity references and relationships
- **File Format**: Validates proper YAML and Markdown formatting
- **Metadata Integrity**: Ensures metadata is properly formatted
- **Naming Conventions**: Verifies proper file naming and organization

## Approval Workflow

1. **Draft Identification**: Locate the draft to be approved
2. **Content Validation**: Check completeness and quality
3. **Entity Validation**: Verify entity consistency and relationships
4. **File Organization**: Ensure proper directory structure
5. **Metadata Check**: Validate metadata formatting and completeness
6. **Approval Decision**: Approve if all checks pass, reject with feedback if not
7. **File Movement**: Move approved files to ready directory
8. **Status Update**: Update draft status and metadata

## Quality Standards

Approved drafts must meet:
- Complete content in all required files
- Consistent entity references and relationships
- Proper file formatting and organization
- Valid metadata and naming conventions
- No broken links or references
- Appropriate content for target audience

## Error Handling

The Approve agent handles validation failures by:
- Providing detailed feedback on what needs to be fixed
- Suggesting specific improvements
- Maintaining draft files for user correction
- Offering guidance on resolution steps
- Allowing re-validation after fixes
