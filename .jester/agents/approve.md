# Approve Agent - Draft Approval

## Purpose

The Approve agent handles the progression of drafts from the draft stage to the reading stage. It performs comprehensive validation including context, outline, and story consistency checks, ensures file integrity, and manages the approval workflow.

## Commands

### No Sub-command
When used without a sub-command, approves the most recent draft:
- Identifies the latest draft number
- Performs comprehensive validation (context, outline, story)
- Validates consistency between all files
- Checks destination readiness
- Moves files to reading stage if validation passes
- Provides feedback on approval status

### `/approve draft {number}`
Approves a specific draft by number:
- Validates the specified draft exists
- Performs comprehensive validation (context, outline, story)
- Validates consistency between all files
- Checks content completeness and quality
- Moves files to reading stage if validation passes
- Updates draft status and metadata

### `/approve all`
Approves all pending drafts:
- Scans for all draft files in the draft directory
- Validates each draft individually with comprehensive checks
- Validates consistency between context, outline, and story
- Approves all valid drafts
- Reports on any drafts that failed validation

### `/approve check`
Checks draft status without approving:
- Analyzes all draft files
- Performs comprehensive validation checks
- Reports on validation status and consistency
- Identifies issues that need to be resolved
- Provides recommendations for improvement

## Validation Process

The Approve agent performs comprehensive validation:
- **File Existence**: Ensures all required files exist
- **Context Validation**: Validates context file for consistency and completeness
- **Outline Validation**: Validates outline file for structure and consistency
- **Story Validation**: Validates story file for quality and adherence to requirements
- **Cross-File Consistency**: Ensures context, outline, and story are consistent with each other
- **Entity Consistency**: Checks entity references and relationships across all files
- **File Format**: Validates proper YAML and Markdown formatting
- **Metadata Integrity**: Ensures metadata is properly formatted
- **Naming Conventions**: Verifies proper file naming and organization
- **Destination Readiness**: Checks that reading directory is prepared for content

## Approval Workflow

1. **Draft Identification**: Locate the draft to be approved
2. **Content Validation**: Check completeness and quality
3. **Entity Validation**: Verify entity consistency and relationships
4. **File Organization**: Ensure proper directory structure
5. **Metadata Check**: Validate metadata formatting and completeness
6. **Approval Decision**: Approve if all checks pass, reject with feedback if not
7. **File Movement**: Move approved files to reading directory
8. **Status Update**: Update draft status and metadata

## Quality Standards

Approved drafts must meet:
- Complete content in all required files
- Consistent entity references and relationships
- Proper file formatting and organization
- Valid metadata and naming conventions
- No broken links or references
- Appropriate content for target audience

## Error Handling

The Approve agent handles validation failures by:
- Providing detailed feedback on what needs to be fixed
- Suggesting specific improvements
- Maintaining draft files for user correction
- Offering guidance on resolution steps
- Allowing re-validation after fixes
