### Command: `/edit approve-draft {draft-number}`

**When activated:**
1. **Read draft files** from `draft/` directory with specified number
2. **Validate draft completeness** (context, outline, story)
3. **Check ready folder for conflicts** - scan for existing files that match the story title
4. **Request user approval** if conflicts found, allowing override option
5. **Move files to ready/** directory with proper naming (no copies left behind)
6. **Generate entity files** for new entities OR create patch files for existing entities
7. **Summarize changes** and provide next steps

**STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS:**

**Step 1: Read and Validate Draft Files**
- Read `draft/context-{number}.md`, `draft/outline-{number}.md`, `draft/story-{number}.md`
- Verify all three files exist and contain valid content
- Extract the story title from the story file (first heading after #)
- Convert story title to hyphenated format (e.g., "Stella's Honest Mistake" → "Stellas-Honest-Mistake")

**Step 2: Check for Conflicts**
- Scan `ready/stories/`, `ready/outlines/`, `ready/contexts/` for files with matching titles
- Look for files like `{hyphenated-title}.md` in each directory
- If conflicts found, report them to user and ask for approval to overwrite

**Step 3: Move Files with Proper Renaming**
- **MOVE** (don't copy) `draft/context-{number}.md` → `ready/contexts/{hyphenated-title} (context).md`
- **MOVE** (don't copy) `draft/outline-{number}.md` → `ready/outlines/{hyphenated-title} (outline).md`
- **MOVE** (don't copy) `draft/story-{number}.md` → `ready/stories/{hyphenated-title}.md`
- **DELETE** original files from draft/ directory after successful move

**Step 4: Extract and Process Entities**
- Parse the story content to identify all [[entity-name]] references
- Categorize entities by type: characters, locations, items
- For each entity, check if it already exists in `complete/` directory
- Create list of new entities vs existing entities

**Step 5: Generate Entity Files**
- **For NEW entities**: Create complete entity files in `ready/` directory:
  - `ready/characters/{entity-name}.md` for character entities
  - `ready/locations/{entity-name}.md` for location entities  
  - `ready/items/{entity-name}.md` for item entities
  - Use standard entity templates with proper markdown formatting
  - Include name, description, relationships, and story appearances
- **For EXISTING entities**: Create patch files showing changes:
  - `ready/patches/{entity-name}-patch.md` with git-patch format
  - Include before/after content showing what changed
  - Example patch format:
    ```
    ---
    Entity: {entity-name}
    Type: character/location/item
    Changes: Added story appearance, updated description, etc.
    
    BEFORE:
    [original content]
    
    AFTER:
    [updated content]
    ---
    ```

**Step 6: Update Entity References**
- Update all [[entity-name]] references in moved files to point to correct locations
- Ensure all entity links are properly formatted

**Step 7: Generate Change Summary**
- List all files moved with old and new names
- List all new entity files created
- List all patch files created for existing entities
- Provide clear summary of what was accomplished

**EXAMPLE OUTPUT FORMAT:**
```
