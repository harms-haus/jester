# Target Audience Management Agent

## Overview

The Audience Agent manages personalized target audience member profiles for children's story generation. It handles profile creation, editing, selection, and intelligent parameter calculation for multiple children.

## Core Functionality

### Profile Management
- **Create Profiles**: Create new target audience member profiles with name, birthday, and preferences
- **Edit Profiles**: Update existing profiles with new preferences or information
- **Delete Profiles**: Remove profiles that are no longer needed
- **List Profiles**: Display all available profiles with key information

### Parameter Calculation
- **Age Calculation**: Automatically calculate current age from birthday information
- **Intelligent Adjustment**: Calculate combined parameters when multiple members are selected
- **Word Count Algorithm**: Sophisticated overlap range algorithm with minimum 200-word range
- **Boundary Validation**: Ensure calculated ranges fit within outer boundaries

### Integration
- **Story Generation**: Seamlessly integrate with existing story generation pipeline
- **Context Generation**: Provide target audience parameters to context generation
- **Parameter Display**: Show calculated ranges and word counts before story generation

## Commands

### `/jester audience create [name] [birthday]`
Creates a new target audience member profile.

**Parameters:**
- `name`: Child's name (required)
- `birthday`: Birthday in ISO format YYYY-MM-DD (required)

**Process:**
1. Validate birthday format and calculate current age
2. Prompt for preferred story length (min, max, target words)
3. Prompt for preferences (themes, characters, settings)
4. Generate unique ID for the profile
5. Save profile to `.memory/target-audience-profiles.yaml`
6. Confirm creation and offer to set as active

**Validation:**
- Birthday must be valid ISO date format
- Birthday cannot be in the future
- Name must be provided and non-empty
- Word count ranges must be logical (min ≤ target ≤ max)

### `/jester audience edit [name]`
Edits an existing target audience member profile.

**Parameters:**
- `name`: Name of the profile to edit (required)

**Process:**
1. Load existing profile from memory
2. Display current profile information
3. Prompt for updates to each field
4. Validate all changes
5. Update profile with new information
6. Recalculate parameters if this member is active
7. Confirm changes

**Validation:**
- Profile must exist
- All validation rules from creation apply
- Changes must be valid before saving

### `/jester audience list`
Lists all target audience member profiles.

**Process:**
1. Load all profiles from memory
2. Display profiles in organized format
3. Show key information: name, age, preferred word count, active status
4. Provide options for further actions

**Display Format:**
```
Target Audience Members:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Name  │ Age │ Preferred Words │ Active │ Last Modified      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Zoe   │ 5   │ 700-900 (800)   │ ✓      │ 2024-12-19 10:30   │
│ Max   │ 3   │ 400-600 (500)   │ ✓      │ 2024-12-19 10:25   │
│ Lily  │ 7   │ 800-1200 (1000) │        │ 2024-12-18 15:45   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### `/jester audience select [name1] [name2] ...`
Selects active target audience members for story generation.

**Parameters:**
- `name1`, `name2`, etc.: Names of members to select (optional, if none provided, show selection menu)

**Process:**
1. Load all available profiles
2. If names provided, validate they exist
3. If no names provided, show selection menu
4. Calculate combined parameters for selected members
5. Display calculated parameters for confirmation
6. Save active member selection to memory
7. Confirm selection and show calculated ranges

**Parameter Calculation:**
- **Age Range**: Calculate min/max ages with wiggle room
- **Word Count**: Use sophisticated overlap range algorithm
- **Display**: Show calculation method and any adjustments made

### `/jester audience delete [name]`
Deletes a target audience member profile.

**Parameters:**
- `name`: Name of the profile to delete (required)

**Process:**
1. Load profile from memory
2. Confirm deletion with user
3. Remove profile from memory
4. If profile was active, recalculate parameters for remaining active members
5. Confirm deletion

**Safety:**
- Require explicit confirmation
- Show profile information before deletion
- Handle active member removal gracefully

### `/jester audience clear`
Clears all active target audience member selections.

**Process:**
1. Confirm clearing of active selections

4. Display calculation method and any adjustments
5. Show when parameters were last calculated

## Parameter Calculation Algorithm

### Age Range Calculation

```pseudocode
calculateAgeRange(activeMembers):
  if activeMembers.length == 0: return null
  
  ages = activeMembers.map(member => calculateAge(member.birthday))
  minAge = min(ages)
  maxAge = max(ages)
  
  return {
    min_age: minAge,
    max_age: maxAge,
    expanded_range: { min_age: max(0, minAge - 1), max_age: maxAge + 1 }
  }
```

### Word Count Calculation (Sophisticated Overlap Range Algorithm)

```pseudocode
calculateTargetLength(activeMembers):
  if activeMembers.length == 0: return null
  if activeMembers.length == 1: return singleMemberCalculation(activeMembers[0])
  
  overlapRange = findOverlapRange(activeMembers)
  if overlapRange:
    centeredRange = centerRangeAroundOverlap(overlapRange, 200)
    outerRange = findOuterRange(activeMembers)
    if centeredRange.exceeds(outerRange):
      return { range: adjustRangeToFit(centeredRange, outerRange), method: 'overlap_range', adjustments: { applied: true, reason: 'exceeded_outer_range' } }
    else:
      return { range: centeredRange, method: 'overlap_range', adjustments: { applied: false } }
  else:
    return { range: createRangeAroundCenter(averageCenters(activeMembers), 200), method: 'average_centers', adjustments: { applied: false } }

findOverlapRange(members):
  maxMin = max(members.map(m => m.preferred_length.min_words))
  minMax = min(members.map(m => m.preferred_length.max_words))
  return maxMin <= minMax ? { min_words: maxMin, max_words: minMax } : null

centerRangeAroundOverlap(overlapRange, minWords):
  overlapSize = overlapRange.max_words - overlapRange.min_words
  if overlapSize < minWords:
    expansion = (minWords - overlapSize) / 2
    return { min_words: max(0, overlapRange.min_words - expansion), max_words: overlapRange.max_words + expansion }
  else:
    return { min_words: max(0, overlapRange.min_words - 50), max_words: overlapRange.max_words + 50 }

adjustRangeToFit(centeredRange, outerRange):
  excess = 0
  if centeredRange.min_words < outerRange.min_words:
    excess += outerRange.min_words - centeredRange.min_words
    centeredRange.min_words = outerRange.min_words
  if centeredRange.max_words > outerRange.max_words:
    excess += centeredRange.max_words - outerRange.max_words
    centeredRange.max_words = outerRange.max_words
  if excess > 0:
    centeredRange.min_words -= floor(excess / 2)
    centeredRange.max_words += ceil(excess / 2)
  return centeredRange
```

## Error Handling

### Profile Validation Errors
- **Invalid Birthday**: "Please provide a valid birthday in YYYY-MM-DD format. Example: 2019-03-15"
- **Future Birthday**: "Birthday cannot be in the future. Please provide a valid past date."
- **Invalid Word Counts**: "Word count ranges must be logical: min ≤ target ≤ max. Please check your values."
- **Missing Name**: "Please provide a name for the target audience member."

### Profile Management Errors
- **Profile Not Found**: "No profile found with name '[name]'. Use '/jester audience list' to see available profiles."
- **Duplicate Name**: "A profile with name '[name]' already exists. Please choose a different name or edit the existing profile."
- **Empty Selection**: "No target audience members selected. Use '/jester audience select' to choose members."

### Calculation Errors
- **No Active Members**: "No active target audience members. Use '/jester audience select' to choose members."
- **Invalid Preferences**: "Some member preferences are invalid. Please check and update profiles."
- **Calculation Failure**: "Unable to calculate parameters. Please check member profiles and try again."
