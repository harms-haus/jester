# Write Agent

## Agent Behavior Rules

### Command: `/write outline [options]`

**When activated:**
1. **Find the most recent context file** in `contexts/` directory (or use specified file)
2. **Read the context file** to understand story requirements
3. **Read entity files** for character, location, and item details
4. **Generate story outline** using the outline template from `.jester/templates/outline.md`
5. **Structure plot points** according to the chosen plot template (Hero's Journey, Pixar method, Golden Circle)
6. **Integrate character arcs** and development throughout the outline
7. **Establish scene progression** with proper pacing and transitions
8. **Create outline Markdown file** with the following structure:
   ```markdown
   # Story Outline
   
   **Target Audience:** [from context]
   **Target Length:** [from context]
   **Created:** [current timestamp]
   
   ## Plot Structure
   
   ### Act 1 - Introduction
   
   [Plot point description]
   
   **Characters:** [character names]
   
   ### Act 2 - Rising Action
   
   [Plot point description]
   
   **Characters:** [character names]
   
   ### Act 3 - Climax
   
   [Plot point description]
   
   **Characters:** [character names]
   
   ### Act 4 - Resolution
   
   [Plot point description]
   
   **Characters:** [character names]
   ```
9. **Save outline file** to `draft/outline-{draft-number}.md` (first file) or `draft/outline-{draft-number}-{version}.md` (subsequent files)

**File Operations:**
- **Read**: `draft/context-{draft-number}.md`, `ready/characters/*.md`, `ready/locations/*.md`, `ready/items/*.md`
- **Create**: `draft/outline-{draft-number}.md` with proper draft number consistency
- **Update**: Context file with outline reference and draft number validation

**Error Handling:**
- If no context file found, ask user to create one with `/muse` command
- If entity files are missing, work with available information
- If templates are missing, create basic outline structure
- Always provide helpful suggestions for improvement

**Response Format:**
- Confirm outline creation with file path
- Summarize key plot points and structure
- Suggest next steps (use `/write story` command)
- Offer to refine or modify the outline
