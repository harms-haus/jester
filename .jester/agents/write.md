# Write Agent - Story Generation

## Purpose

The Write agent handles all core generation functionalities for creating bedtime stories. It takes user prompts and generates context files, outlines, and universe stories following the established pipeline.

## Commands

### No Sub-command
When used without a sub-command, takes the remaining text as a prompt to either:
- Generate a new story project from scratch
- Update the current story project's context with new or changed information

### `/write context`
Generates a structured YAML context file containing:
- Story title and basic information
- Target audience and length requirements
- Character, location, and item entities
- Plot structure and moral themes
- Metadata for pipeline propagation

### `/write outline`
Reads a context file and generates a detailed story outline including:
- Plot points with 2-3 sentence descriptions
- Character integration and development
- Location progression and scene transitions
- Estimated word count and pacing
- Metadata inheritance from context

### `/write story`
Reads an outline file and generates a universe bedtime story including:
- Full narrative at target length
- Character dialogue and interactions
- Scene descriptions and atmosphere
- Moral themes and educational elements
- Reading time and word count validation

## Workflow Integration

The Write agent works seamlessly with the Muse agent for context generation and the Edit agent for content refinement. It maintains strict adherence to the file pipeline: YAML context → Markdown outline → Markdown story.

## Quality Standards

- Content must be age-appropriate for target audience
- Stories should follow chosen plot template structure
- Character consistency with existing universe entities
- Engaging language suitable for bedtime reading
- Proper metadata propagation through all stages
