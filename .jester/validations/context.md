# Context Validation

## Purpose

Validate `context` files before `outline` generation to ensure quality, completeness, and logical coherence

## Definitions

- a `context` is the story's "bones" without the "meat"
- an `entity` is a `character`, `location`, or `item`
- `entities` collectively refer to all characters, locations, and items in the story

## Instructions for Agent

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - CONTEXT VALIDATION

This checklist is for AGENTS to validate content

EXECUTION APPROACH:

1. Go through each section systematically
2. Mark items as [x] Done, [ ] Not Done, or [N/A] Not Applicable
