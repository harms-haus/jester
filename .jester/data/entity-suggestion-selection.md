# Entity Suggestion and Selection

## Entity Suggestion System

**IMPORTANT: READ-ONLY LightRAG Integration**
All LightRAG operations are read-only. The system only queries LightRAG to discover and suggest entities, never modifies the LightRAG knowledge graph. Local entity files remain the primary source of truth.

### Entity Suggestion Algorithm

**LLM Agent Instructions for Entity Suggestions:**

1. **Analyze Story Context**: Review the story concept, themes, and target audience to understand entity requirements.

2. **Score Entity Relevance**: For each discovered LightRAG entity, calculate relevance scores based on:
   - **Story Fit** (0.0-1.0): How well the entity fits the story concept and themes
   - **Age Appropriateness** (boolean): Whether the entity is suitable for the target audience age
   - **Thematic Alignment** (0.0-1.0): How well the entity matches the story's themes and morals
   - **Character Diversity** (0.0-1.0): Whether the entity adds diversity to the character mix

3. **Generate Entity Suggestions**: Create structured suggestions with:
   - Entity name and description
   - Relevance score and reasoning
   - Suggested role in the story
   - Age-appropriateness assessment
   - Thematic fit evaluation

4. **Present Suggestions**: Display entity suggestions in organized format with clear selection options.

### Entity Selection Process

**LLM Agent Instructions for Entity Selection:**

1. **Present Entity Options**: Show 3-5 top suggestions per category with clear formatting.

2. **Handle User Selection**: Process user choices:
   - Accept specific entity selections
   - Handle "none" or "skip" responses
   - Allow "more" requests for additional suggestions
   - Process "all" selections for categories

3. **Integrate Selected Entities**: Add selected entities to the context template:
   - Include LightRAG metadata (source, confidence, query used)
   - Set appropriate entity properties and relationships
   - Maintain entity source tracking (local vs LightRAG)

4. **Provide Confirmation**: Confirm selected entities and their roles in the story.

### Entity Integration Workflow

**LLM Agent Instructions for Entity Integration:**

1. **Validate Selected Entities**: Ensure selected entities are appropriate and consistent.

2. **Generate Entity Metadata**: Create comprehensive metadata for each selected entity:
   - Source tracking (LightRAG vs local)
   - Discovery timestamp and query used
   - Confidence scores and reasoning
   - Suggested properties and relationships

3. **Update Context Template**: Integrate entities into the context file:
   - Add entities to appropriate sections (characters, locations, items)
   - Include LightRAG metadata for tracking
   - Set entity relationships and properties
   - Maintain consistency with story requirements

4. **Quality Assurance**: Verify entity integration:
   - Check for conflicts or inconsistencies
   - Ensure age-appropriateness
   - Validate thematic alignment
   - Confirm entity diversity and balance

### Error Handling for Entity Suggestions

**No Suitable Entities Found:**
```
üîç No Suitable Entities Found

I searched LightRAG for entities relevant to your story concept, but didn't find any that perfectly match your requirements. This could mean:

- Your story concept is very unique and original
- The LightRAG knowledge graph doesn't have entities for this specific theme
- The search criteria were too specific

üîÑ Options:
1. Try broader search terms
2. Use local entities from your story universe
3. Create new entities based on your story concept
4. Continue without additional entities

What would you like to do?
```

**LightRAG Service Unavailable:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è LightRAG Service Unavailable

The LightRAG service is currently not accessible, so I can't search for additional entities. However, I can still help you create a rich story context using:

üîÑ Available Options:
1. Local entities from your story universe
2. My knowledge base for entity suggestions
3. Create new entities based on your story concept
4. Use existing entities and expand them

Would you like me to proceed with local entity suggestions?
```

**Entity Selection Conflicts:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Entity Selection Conflict

- [Entity A] and [Entity B] have conflicting themes
- [Entity C] might not be age-appropriate for your target audience

üîÑ Resolution Options:
1. Choose alternative entities
2. Modify the conflicting entities
3. Adjust your story concept to accommodate the entities
4. Remove the conflicting entities

How would you like to resolve this conflict?
```
