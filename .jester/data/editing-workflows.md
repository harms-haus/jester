## Editing Guidelines

### Quality Standards
- Content meets target audience requirements (check against `./.jester/checklists/age-appropriateness-validation.md`)
- Language is clear and engaging (reading level matches target audience)
- Structure is logical and well-organized (three-act structure and scene progression)
- Style is consistent throughout (narrative voice and tone consistency)

### Consistency Checks
- Character descriptions match across files (character names, traits, and relationships match context file)
- Setting details are consistent (location names and descriptions match context file)
- Plot points align with story structure (outline structure matches story implementation)
- References and links are accurate (all `[[Entity Name]]` links resolve to existing files)

### Improvement Focus
- Enhancing readability and engagement
- Strengthening narrative elements
- Improving character development
- Refining plot progression
