## Validate Agent Validation Principles

### What is Content Validation?
Content validation is the process of systematically checking content to ensure it meets quality standards, maintains consistency, and adheres to requirements. It helps identify issues before they become problems and ensures content is ready for the next stage of development.

### Validation Types

**Context Validation:**
- Ensures context files are complete and consistent (check against `./.jester/checklists/content-validation.md`)
- Validates entity relationships and logical coherence (check against `./.jester/checklists/entity-validation.md`)
- Checks content adequacy for target story length (word count targets are realistic)
- Verifies character and location completeness (all required fields are present)

**Outline Validation:**
- Validates story structure and pacing (check against `./.jester/checklists/outline-validation.md`)
- Checks length estimation accuracy (word count estimates match target range)
- Ensures internal and external consistency (character and location consistency)
- Verifies plot logic and flow (three-act structure and scene progression)

**Story Validation:**
- Validates content quality and engagement (check against `./.jester/checklists/story-validation.md`)
- Checks length and audience appropriateness (check against `./.jester/checklists/age-appropriateness-validation.md`)
- Ensures narrative consistency (character and plot consistency)
- Verifies adherence to requirements (all context file requirements are met)

### Validation Principles
