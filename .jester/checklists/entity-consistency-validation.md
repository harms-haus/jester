# Entity Consistency Validation Checklist

## Instructions for Validate Agent

Before proceeding with story progression, please go through each item in this checklist. Report the status of each item (e.g., [x] Done, [ ] Not Done, [N/A] Not Applicable) and provide brief comments if necessary.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - ENTITY CONSISTENCY VALIDATION

This checklist is for VALIDATE AGENTS to validate entity consistency before story progression.

IMPORTANT: This is a comprehensive validation. Be thorough about checking each item. It's better to identify consistency issues now than have them cause problems during story progression.

EXECUTION APPROACH:

1. Go through each section systematically
2. Mark items as [x] Done, [ ] Not Done, or [N/A] Not Applicable
3. Add brief comments explaining any [ ] or [N/A] items
4. Be specific about what was actually validated
5. Flag any consistency issues or concerns

The goal is ensuring entity consistency and readiness for story progression.]]

## Final Confirmation

[[LLM: FINAL ENTITY CONSISTENCY VALIDATION SUMMARY

After completing the checklist:

1. Summarize what was validated for entity consistency
2. List any items marked as [ ] Not Done with explanations
3. Identify any consistency issues or concerns
4. Note any recommendations for improvement
5. Confirm whether the entities are ready for story progression

Be thorough - it's better to identify consistency issues now than have them cause problems later.]]

- [ ] I, the Validate Agent, confirm that all applicable items above have been addressed and the entities are consistent and ready for story progression.
