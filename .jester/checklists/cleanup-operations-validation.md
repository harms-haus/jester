# Cleanup Operations Validation Checklist

## Purpose

To validate cleanup operations, ensuring all cleanup tasks are properly completed and system integrity is maintained.

## Instructions for Cleanup Agent

Before completing cleanup operations, please go through each item in this checklist. Report the status of each item (e.g., [x] Done, [ ] Not Done, [N/A] Not Applicable) and provide brief comments if necessary.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - CLEANUP OPERATIONS VALIDATION

This checklist is for CLEANUP AGENTS to validate cleanup operations before completing the process.

IMPORTANT: This is a critical validation step. Be thorough about what cleanup operations are actually completed vs what still needs attention. It's better to ensure complete cleanup than to have lingering issues.

EXECUTION APPROACH:

1. Go through each section systematically
2. Mark items as [x] Done, [ ] Not Done, or [N/A] Not Applicable
3. Add brief comments explaining any [ ] or [N/A] items
4. Be specific about what was actually validated
5. Flag any concerns or potential issues

The goal is complete cleanup, not just checking boxes.]]
