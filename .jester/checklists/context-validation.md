# Context Validation Checklist

## Instructions for Validate Agent

Before proceeding with outline generation, please go through each item in this checklist. Report the status of each item (e.g., [x] Done, [ ] Not Done, [N/A] Not Applicable) and provide brief comments if necessary.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - CONTEXT VALIDATION

This checklist is for VALIDATE AGENTS to validate context files before outline generation.

IMPORTANT: This is a comprehensive validation. Be thorough about checking each item. It's better to identify issues now than have them cause problems during outline generation.

EXECUTION APPROACH:

1. Go through each section systematically
2. Mark items as [x] Done, [ ] Not Done, or [N/A] Not Applicable
3. Add brief comments explaining any [ ] or [N/A] items
4. Be specific about what was actually validated
5. Flag any concerns or quality issues

The goal is ensuring context quality and readiness for outline generation.]]
