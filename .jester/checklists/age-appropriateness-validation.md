[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - AGE APPROPRIATENESS VALIDATION

This checklist is for CONTENT AGENTS to validate age-appropriateness before publishing content.

IMPORTANT: This is a critical validation step. Be thorough about what content is actually appropriate vs what should be modified. It's better to err on the side of caution for child safety.

EXECUTION APPROACH:

1. Go through each section systematically
2. Mark items as [x] Done, [ ] Not Done, or [N/A] Not Applicable
3. Add brief comments explaining any [ ] or [N/A] items
4. Be specific about what was actually validated
5. Flag any concerns or potential issues

The goal is child-safe content, not just checking boxes.]]
