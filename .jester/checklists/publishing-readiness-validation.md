# Publishing Readiness Validation Checklist

## Purpose

To validate publishing readiness, ensuring all content is ready for publication to the universe stage.

## Instructions for Publish Agent

Before publishing content, please go through each item in this checklist. Report the status of each item (e.g., [x] Done, [ ] Not Done, [N/A] Not Applicable) and provide brief comments if necessary.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - PUBLISHING READINESS VALIDATION

This checklist is for PUBLISH AGENTS to validate publishing readiness before publishing content.

IMPORTANT: This is a critical validation step. Be thorough about what content is actually ready vs what needs attention. It's better to ensure quality before publishing than to have issues in the universe.

EXECUTION APPROACH:

1. Go through each section systematically
2. Mark items as [x] Done, [ ] Not Done, or [N/A] Not Applicable
3. Add brief comments explaining any [ ] or [N/A] items
4. Be specific about what was actually validated
5. Flag any concerns or potential issues

The goal is quality publishing, not just checking boxes.]]
