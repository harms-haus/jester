# Outline Validation Checklist

## Instructions for Validate Agent

Before proceeding with story generation, please go through each item in this checklist. Report the status of each item (e.g., [x] Done, [ ] Not Done, [N/A] Not Applicable) and provide brief comments if necessary.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - OUTLINE VALIDATION

This checklist is for VALIDATE AGENTS to validate outline files before story generation.

IMPORTANT: This is a comprehensive validation. Be thorough about checking each item. It's better to identify issues now than have them cause problems during story generation.

EXECUTION APPROACH:

1. Go through each section systematically
2. Mark items as [x] Done, [ ] Not Done, or [N/A] Not Applicable
3. Add brief comments explaining any [ ] or [N/A] items
4. Be specific about what was actually validated
5. Flag any concerns or quality issues

The goal is ensuring outline quality and readiness for story generation.]]

## Checklist Items

   - [ ] Scene progression is logical and engaging
   - [ ] Character arcs are complete and meaningful (follows context file specifications)

3. **Length Validation:**

   [[LLM: Ensure length estimates are realistic and appropriate]]
   - [ ] Estimated word count is realistic (within target range from context file)
   - [ ] Scene count appropriate for length (allows adequate development within word limit)
   - [ ] Character development suitable for length (arcs can be completed within estimated length)
   - [ ] Plot complexity matches target length (appropriate for target word count)

4. **Internal Consistency Validation:**

   [[LLM: Check internal logic and flow of the outline]]
   - [ ] Story events follow logical sequence
   - [ ] Character actions are consistent
   - [ ] Location transitions are believable
   - [ ] Plot points connect smoothly

5. **External Consistency Validation:**

   [[LLM: Verify consistency with universe rules and constraints]]
   - [ ] Characters match universe descriptions
   - [ ] Locations align with universe settings
   - [ ] Items fit universe rules
   - [ ] Events respect universe constraints

6. **Template Compliance Validation:**

   [[LLM: Ensure outline follows required template structure]]
   - [ ] Outline follows markdown template structure (matches `./.jester/templates/outline-template.md`)
   - [ ] All required sections are present (template sections filled with content)
   - [ ] Formatting is consistent and correct (heading structure and markdown formatting)

## Final Confirmation

[[LLM: FINAL OUTLINE VALIDATION SUMMARY

After completing the checklist:

1. Summarize what was validated in this outline
2. List any items marked as [ ] Not Done with explanations
3. Identify any quality issues or concerns
4. Note any recommendations for improvement
5. Confirm whether the outline is ready for story generation

Be thorough - it's better to identify issues now than have them cause problems later.]]

- [ ] I, the Validate Agent, confirm that all applicable items above have been addressed and the outline is ready for story generation.
