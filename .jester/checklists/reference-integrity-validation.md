# Reference Integrity Validation Checklist

## Purpose

To validate reference integrity, ensuring all references are valid, accessible, and consistent across the system.

## Instructions for System Agent

Before performing system operations, please go through each item in this checklist. Report the status of each item (e.g., [x] Done, [ ] Not Done, [N/A] Not Applicable) and provide brief comments if necessary.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - REFERENCE INTEGRITY VALIDATION

This checklist is for SYSTEM AGENTS to validate reference integrity before performing operations.

IMPORTANT: This is a critical validation step. Be thorough about what references are actually valid vs what needs repair. It's better to identify broken references early than to have system failures.

EXECUTION APPROACH:

1. Go through each section systematically
2. Mark items as [x] Done, [ ] Not Done, or [N/A] Not Applicable
3. Add brief comments explaining any [ ] or [N/A] items
4. Be specific about what was actually validated
5. Flag any concerns or potential issues

The goal is reference reliability, not just checking boxes.]]
