# Story Context: Stacy's Village Rescue

## Story Overview

Lily and Rascal are enjoying a peaceful day at the beach when their friend Benny Shark arrives with urgent news. Stacy Stingray's underwater village is under attack by mysterious forces, and she desperately needs their help. However, to reach the stingray village, Lily needs a magic snorkel that allows her to breathe underwater for extended periods. The magic snorkel is guarded by Gulp Gull, a stubborn seagull who won't give it up easily. Rascal must solve a clever riddle to convince the seagull to part with the magical item so they can save Stacy's village.

## Character Dynamics

- Graceful stingray homes built among coral formations
- Community gathering areas where stingrays normally meet
- Defensive positions and hiding spots
- Evidence of the mysterious attack (damaged structures, worried residents)

### Seagull's Perch
A rocky outcrop where Gulp Gull guards his treasure:
- High rocky formation jutting out of the water
- Gulp Gull's nest filled with collected treasures
- The magic snorkel hidden among his hoard

- Wind-swept and isolated, perfect for a stubborn guardian

### The Magic Snorkel
A special underwater breathing device:

Stacy Stingray's village is under attack by mysterious forces. The stingrays are in danger and need immediate help, but Lily can't reach them without the magic snorkel that allows her to breathe underwater for extended periods.

### The Challenge
