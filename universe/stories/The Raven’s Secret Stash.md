In [[Lily]]'s [[Garden]], where daisies turned their golden heads toward the sun and carrots poked shyly from the earth, a single midnight‑black feather drifted down like a whispered secret. Lily—curious, brave, and forever on the lookout for hidden wonders—bent low, her fingertips brushing the soft soil. She slipped the sleek [[Raven's Feather]] into her pocket, feeling the faint hum of adventure beginning to chime in her head.  

[[Rascal]], her mischievous but loyal sidekick, padded up with his whiskers twitching. “A feather means someone’s left a clue,” he chittered, his amber eyes bright. “Let’s see where it leads.” Lily put her tiny [[wooden spoon]]—her trusty adventuring tool—in her [[basket]], just in case the journey demanded a little extra bravery.  

The pair stepped off the [[Rickety Bridge]] and into the [[Whispering Woods]]. Tall trunks leaned close together, their leaves rustling like an old choir murmuring ancient songs. The wind carried soft sighs that seemed to point the way. Lily followed the feather’s faint pull, while Rascal darted ahead, sniffing the mossy floor and keeping an ear out for any trouble.  

Soon the path opened into the [[Old-growth Forest]], a place where towering trees stretched like stone pillars and the ground was carpeted with ferns and soft pine needles. Sunlight faltered in the branches, the floor beneath was dark as night. Beneath a fallen log, Lily spotted a second coal-black feather. Nestled beside it lay a plain, warm‑to‑the‑touch coin.  

“[[Poe Raven]] must have left this,” Lily whispered, turning the [[coin]] over. Its surface was plain, but the faint engraving of a beak hinted at its owner—a raven known for collecting shiny things. Rascal’s ears perked. “Poe’s the coin‑loving raven who lives deep in these woods. He’s always digging for treasure.”  

They pressed on, following the faint trail of glittering bits. After a short climb, they arrived at a small clearing where a tangled pile of junk—old bottles, broken twigs, rusted metal, and scattered coins—mounded together like a chaotic hill. In the middle of the mess, a glossy black raven with bright, inquisitive eyes was busy digging, his claws deftly moving through the debris.  

“Poe!” Lily called, excitement bubbling in her voice. The raven kept digging, paying no heed to Lily's call. He was too busy with his task to notice them. 

Just then, a low, guttural growl rumbled through the trees. From the shadows leapt [[Wally Wolf]], massive and hungry, his eyes fixed on the raven as he ran. “Mmm~ dark dinner,” he snarled, lunging forward with a thunderous pounce, claws outstretched.  

[[Lily]]’s heart hammered, but she remembered the [[wooden spoon]] in her hand. With a swift, decisive motion, she thrust the spoon forward, aiming for the wolf’s snout. The spoon clanged against his teeth, startling him and forcing him to halt mid‑air. The sudden clang echoed through the clearing, buying the friends a precious heartbeat.  

Rascal, never one to stay still, sprang into action, readying his claws. He slashed at Wally’s flank, his tiny claws digging into the wolf’s thick fur. “Get outta' here!” Rascal chittered, his voice fierce despite his small size. The wolf yelped in surprise, stumbling backward as Rascal’s quick strike hit a soft spot beneath his ribs.  

The wolf snarled, his eyes flashing with frustration, but he was now out-numbered. “Back off, Wally!” Lily shouted, standing tall despite the trembling of her knees.  

Poe, still perched on the edge of his junk heap, flapped his wings and cawed, “Enough! Wally go home before you get hurt!” He swooped down, landing on Lily's shoulder, his dark feathers bristling. The wolf, now more annoyed than hungry, gave a final, frustrated whimper and retreated into the deeper shadows, his silhouette disappearing among the ancient trees.  

The forest fell quiet once more, the only sounds the soft rustle of leaves and the distant chirp of crickets. Poe shook his feathers, scattering a few stray coins that clinked merrily on the forest floor. “You both saved me,” he said, his voice softer now. “For my gratitude, take this.” He placed a tarnished [[Ancient Bird Coin]] into Lily’s palm. Its crusted center bore the delicate shape of a raven’s beak, gleaming faintly in the dappled light.  

“Follow me,” Poe croaked, leading them toward a massive hollow in a towering oak. Inside, the hollow opened into a three‑story nest built of twigs, leaves, and an endless mountain of glittering coins—[[Poe's palace]], a towering treasury of gold coins collected over countless seasons.  

The nest glittered like a sunrise trapped in metal. Each level was a maze of coin‑covered platforms, with golden, silver, and copper pieces reflecting the fading light. Poe flapped his wings, guiding Lily and Rascal to a cozy nook on the middle floor. He set out three acorn cups filled with warm honey‑sweetened tea, the steam rising like soft clouds.  

As they sipped, the sun slipped behind the horizon, painting the sky in shades of amber and rose. Lily held the Ancient Bird Coin close, feeling its cool weight against her palm. “Your collection is amazing,” she said, eyes shining. “Every coin tells a story, just like every feather leads to a new adventure.” 

Poe nodded, his beak curving into a gentle smile. “Indeed. And now, you have a piece of my story, too.” Nodding to the [[Ancient Bird Coin]]. “Take that as a promise: whenever you need help, call my name, and I’ll come to aid you.”  

Rascal curled up on the soft moss, his tail draped over the edge of his cup. He let out a contented sigh, the fight’s adrenaline fading into calm. 

When the dusk turned to dark, Lily and Rascal retraced their steps through Whispering Woods, the ancient trees whispering their goodbyes. The moon painted the path silver, and the night air smelled of pine and distant rain. When they emerged back into Lily’s garden, the daisies swayed as if applauding their return.  

Lily placed the feather and the Ancient Bird Coin on her windowsill. She tucked the wooden spoon into her pocket, feeling its familiar weight as a reminder of quick thinking and courage.  

With the soft murmur of crickets outside, Lily’s eyes fluttered shut. In her dreams, she and Rascal roamed the glittering halls of Poe’s nest, sharing tea with the raven and laughing as the ancient coins sang their metallic lullaby. The memory of the wooden spoon’s brave clang and Rascal’s daring dash against [[Wally Wolf]] lingered, a comforting promise that even the smallest heroes could guard the biggest treasures.  

And as the night deepened, the garden’s daisies swayed gently, whispering a goodnight song to the brave girl, her clever raccoon, and the raven who watched over them all.  

*The End.*
