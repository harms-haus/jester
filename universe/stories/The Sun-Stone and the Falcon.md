The [[Whispering Woods]] gently sang soft lullabies as [[Lily]] skipped hand‑in‑hand with Rascal, their footsteps rustling pine needles and making the forest hum. Suddenly, a dark silhouette cut the sky. [[Zephyr Falcon]], faster than a wind‑song, swooped down and clutched [[Rascal]] in its sharp talons. "Rascal!" Lily shouted, her heart beating like a drum.

She stared up at the jagged cliffs where the [[falcon's eyrie]] perched, feeling the flutter of fear in her belly. Just then, a gentle hoot floated down from an ancient oak. [[Oliver Owl]] settled on a low branch, his amber eyes kind. "Little one, the woods hold a secret that can calm even the fiercest storm," he whispered. "Seek [[Sun-Stone]] in the [[Firefly Glade]]. Its light will guide you."

Following Oliver's clue, Lily hurried deeper until she found a quiet, shaded clearing. Fireflies twinkled like tiny lanterns in the dark, even though the sun shone bright above the dense canopy. In the center of the glade lay a dark stone on a stone pedestal, sealed tight and pulsing with a low glow. The light of the [[Sun-Stone]] has dimmed and almost gone out. Beside it, a majestic eagle—[[Ari Eagle]]—sat with a wing folded. She tries to move but instead shows a wince of pain.

"Ari! Oh, are you hurt?" Lily asked, kneeling beside the great bird. Ari gave a soft, grateful nod. Lily remembered the forest herbs Oliver had spoken of: lavender, mint, and a sprig of pine. She gently pressed the fragrant paste onto Ari's wing, humming a soothing tune. The eagle's eyes brightened, and with a slow, grateful flap she lifted her wing enough to glide a short distance.

"Thank you, brave Lily," Ari called, her voice warm as sunrise. "Now, let us free the [[Sun-Stone]] together." Ari flapped her strong wing and dove through the canopy, pushing aside a thick curtain of leaves and creating a tiny hole for a sliver of light to peer down. Sunlight slipped through the gap, painting a silver line on the glade floor.

Lily dusted the sun-stone off with her hands, feeling a cool pulse. She raised the smooth [[Reflective Stone]] she had found earlier gauging its weight to be about the weight of the sun-stone and positioning it to replace the stone just in case there's a hair-trigger trap. As the beam struck, the [[Sun-Stone]] shimmered, its inner darkness melting away like morning mist. A warm, golden glow burst forth, spilling over the pedestal and bathing the whole clearing in soft light.

"The light will calm the falcon," Oliver hooted from his branch, his eyes glittering with approval. "It's ready, now. Take it."

Lily steadied herself, ready to make the switch. She moved her hands close and... swap! She now had the warm sun-stone in her hand and the river pebble is on the pedestal. No traps seemed to have clicked...

With the [[Sun-Stone]] cradled safely, Lily turned back toward the towering rocks that led to the [[Falcon's Eyrie]]. The cliffs rose like stone giants, and Lily's knees trembled. But Ari, now able to lift herself higher, swooped down and hovered beside Lily. "Feel the wind, Lily. Trust the light inside you," she urged, her recovered wing beating a steady rhythm.

Step by step, Lily climbed, the Sun‑Stone’s glow guiding each handhold. The wind sang through the trees, and Ari’s encouraging calls echoed around the cliffs. At the summit, the falcon perched on a jagged perch, eyes fierce but wavering as the Sun‑Stone’s brilliance washed over it. "I am [[Zephyr Falcon]]. What are you doing in my Eyrie?" said the falcon.

“Please, mighty Zephyr,” Lily called, voice steady. “Return Rascal. The forest is brighter when friends are together.” The falcon lowered its head, its fierce glare softening. With a gentle swoop, it released Rascal, who tumbled safely into Lily’s outstretched arms.

"I'm sorry. I was wrong to take you, Rascal," the falcon whispered, its feathers shimmering in the Sun‑Stone's light. "You, [[Lily]] have shown true courage."

Ari spread her healed wings wide, and Lily hopped onto her back. Together, they rose above the [[Whispering Woods]], the Sun‑Stone's glow trailing like a comet. The forest below glittered with fireflies, and the wind sang a lullaby of bravery.

They glided back to Lily's cottage, where Mom waited with a warm smile. Rascal scampered to his favorite cushion, and Oliver perched on the windowsill, nodding wisely. Ari landed gently on the garden fence, her wing fully healed, and promised to watch over the woods whenever Lily needed a friend in the sky.

That night, under a sky dotted with stars, Lily tucked herself into bed, the Sun‑Stone's soft light still humming on her night‑stand. She whispered, "Even the darkest stone can shine when we share our light." And the forest, the owl, the eagle, and the fireflies all sang a quiet, happy lullaby, reminding her that friendship grows brighter with a heart kindled by courage.
