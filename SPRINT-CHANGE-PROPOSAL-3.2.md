# Sprint Change Proposal - Story 3.2 Simplification

**Date**: 2025-01-27  
**Author**: Sarah (Product Owner)  
**Status**: Approved and Implemented

## Executive Summary

Story 3.2 (LightRAG Query Integration) has been successfully simplified to focus on core LightRAG query integration without over-complicated validation systems, export functionality, or detailed implementation workflows. The story now aligns with the user's requirement to simply ensure agents know about LightRAG MCP availability for deep relationship information.

## Analysis Summary

### Original Issue
Story 3.2 had become over-complicated with:
- 9 acceptance criteria (reduced to 4)
- 8 major tasks with 40+ subtasks (reduced to 3 tasks with 7 subtasks)
- Complex validation integration requirements
- Detailed export functionality
- Extensive progression validation workflows

### Impact Assessment
- **Epic Impact**: Epic 3 (LightRAG Integration) remains valid but simplified
- **Artifact Impact**: No conflicts with PRD or architecture documents
- **Future Epic Impact**: No impact on Epics 4 or 5
- **MVP Impact**: Simplification makes MVP more achievable

### Recommended Path
**Direct Adjustment** - Simplify Story 3.2 by removing over-complicated systems while keeping core LightRAG query integration functionality.

## Specific Changes Implemented

### 1. Story 3.2 Acceptance Criteria (Simplified)

**Before (9 criteria):**
1. Context generation queries LightRAG for relevant entities during `/muse` command
2. Entity suggestions are provided based on story context and requirements
3. Entity filtering allows selection of relevant entities from LightRAG results
4. Entity integration incorporates selected entities into local story context
5. Entity validation ensures suggested entities fit the story requirements
6. Entity export saves selected entities to local entity files
7. Query optimization minimizes LightRAG queries while maximizing relevance
8. Story progression validation ensures entity quality before draft → ready progression
9. Entity formatting validation validates entity files before ready → published progression

**After (4 criteria):**
1. **Context generation** queries LightRAG for relevant entities during `/muse` command
2. **Entity suggestions** are provided based on story context and requirements
3. **Entity integration** incorporates selected entities into local story context
4. **Query optimization** minimizes LightRAG queries while maximizing relevance

### 2. Story 3.2 Tasks (Simplified)

**Before:** 8 major tasks with 40+ subtasks

**After:** 3 simple tasks with 7 subtasks
- Task 1: Implement LightRAG Context Generation (3 subtasks)
- Task 2: Implement Entity Suggestion System (2 subtasks)  
- Task 3: Implement Entity Integration (2 subtasks)

### 3. Epic 3 PRD Section (Updated)

**Before:** 7 acceptance criteria in Epic 3 Story 3.2

**After:** 4 acceptance criteria matching the simplified story

### 4. Dev Notes (Simplified)

**Removed:**
- Complex validation integration requirements
- Detailed validation task breakdown
- Complex testing requirements

**Kept:**
- Basic API specifications
- Simple component specifications
- Basic file locations
- Core data models

## Implementation Status

✅ **Story 3.2**: Simplified acceptance criteria and tasks  
✅ **Epic 3 PRD**: Updated to match simplified story  
✅ **Dev Notes**: Streamlined to focus on core integration  

## Next Steps

1. **Development Agent**: Implement the simplified Story 3.2 when ready
2. **QA Agent**: Review simplified story for completeness
3. **Scrum Master**: Update backlog prioritization if needed

## Success Criteria

- [x] Story 3.2 focuses on core LightRAG query integration
- [x] Complex validation systems removed
- [x] Export functionality removed
- [x] Epic 3 PRD updated to match
- [x] Story remains implementable and valuable
